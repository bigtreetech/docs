This expansion can be very significant and it can result in poor first layers when using other probes.

Therefore, if you later try to perform a paper test and only have either the nozzle or the heated bed turned on you may find that there is about a 0.05 gap (not enough to cause a first layer issue but enough to feel less of a pinch on the paper).

Thus, scanning is not possible on beds with severe surface deviation or beds with extreme tilt that hasn't been corrected.</p>"},{"location":"Eddy.html#rapid-continuous-scanning","title":"Rapid (Continuous) Scanning","text":"<p>When performing a rapid bed mesh scan there is little time to accumulate many samples per point so that they can be averaged and have noise removed. Therefore, a rapid scan may not be as accurate as a standard bed mesh scan but in most cases it will still produce a fine first layer.</p> <p>Rapid scans can be improved by allowing the travel planner to slightly overshoot the scanned bed mesh and smooth the moves. You can configure  this overshoot in the bed_mesh configuration section using the scan_overshoot: parameter. Note that you will need to ensure that the axis can travel to the mesh boundary plus this overshoot value on your printer so be careful not to specify a value that is too high. Usually, 8mm is plenty.</p>"},{"location":"Eddy.html#faq-frequently-asked-questions","title":"FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions","text":"<p>1.Sometimes I get \"Error during homing probe: Eddy current sensor error\"</p> <ul> <li>This generally indicates that the oscillator within the Eddy sensor is not at a valid value before the probe/homing attempt starts. We recommend trying the following steps:</li> </ul> <p>1\uff09Double check your probe height. It may be that it is too close to the bed or too high. Remember that we recommend that it is at 2mm-3mm above the bed when the nozzle is just touching the bed. Around 2.5mm is optimal in most cases but if you are finding that your probe is having errors at high temperatures then try to drop it just below 2mm. However, if your probe is having errors during QGL attempts then you may need to raise it slightly.</p> <p>2\uff09After you have adjusted the probe height, remove all of the calibration settings from your config file and recalibrate the eddy.</p> <p>3\uff09If you still receive this error then increase the reg_drive_current value to 16 from 15 if it is currently set to 15.</p> <p>2.Sometimes I get a \"Probe Triggered Before Movement\" Error</p> <ul> <li>This will happen when you try to execute two successive PROBE commands. Always raise the gantry by a few mm between PROBE commands to avoid this.</li> </ul> <p>3.Eddy is performing Z Hops when running Bed Mesh</p> <ul> <li>Make sure you are using the correct macro call. BED_MESH_CALIBRATE METHOD=rapid_scan</li> <li>Remove or alter KAMP - Adaptive Bed Mesh and any custom BED_MESH_CALIBRATE macros. Use klipper adaptive mesh instead or alternatively do not include KAMP/Adaptive_Meshing.cfg in your KAMP_Settings.cfg</li> </ul> <p>4.Which Eddy version should I use?</p> <ul> <li>It depends on your needs. Eddy USB and Eddy Coil are nearly identical, however Eddy Coil is more for toolhead boards and connects via I2C connectors.</li> <li>Eddy Coil does not have temperature compensation and so it may be less reliable for homing if you are using it within a sealed chamber.</li> </ul> <p>5.Error: gcode command &lt; ANY GCODE COMMAND &gt; already registered</p> <ul> <li>This will happen when you have conflicting gcode macros. Check all of your gcode macros for ones that share the same name and arbitrate the conflicts. Generally, you should select the functionality from the Eddy macros if there is a conflict and you are not sure what to do.</li> </ul> <p>6.My z-offset doesn\u2019t seem to save and resets, is there a work around or fix?</p> <ul> <li>Coming from a standard probe, this may seem like a bug. However, if you have calibrated the Eddy correctly and are using the special homing macros, then there will be no need for a z-offset. Explaining why is a bit long winded but essentially when it comes to an Eddy, the z-offset parameter does not adjust the height at which the nozzle prints, it just adjusts the height at which homing or probing triggers.</li> <li>While we strongly recommend simply performing the Eddy probe calibration in order to get a nozzle height that is just right, you can still simulate a standard z-offset by using the Z-offset beta sample configuration file. Simply uncomment any macro that is related to the beta z-offset functionality and you will be able to use the standard mainsail buttons to raise/lower the nozzle and save that height as a z-offset.</li> </ul> <p>7.My Eddy Macros Conflict with My KNOMI Macros</p> <ul> <li>The Eddy and the KNOMI share similar Macros. All of the needed functionality for the KNOMI has been built into the Eddy macros. Please comment out the KNOMI macros which conflict and use the Eddy macros.</li> <li>Note that you may need to uncomment some lines in the Eddy macros that are specifically included for people who run the KNOMI. Check the macros to see which lines have been commented and then uncomment them if they are needed for KNOMI.</li> </ul> <p>8.KAMP and Eddy</p> <ul> <li>KAMP aka Klipper-Adaptive-Meshing-Purging should be removed from your Klipper prior to using Eddy. Please comment out the include line. ie#[include ./KAMP/adaptive_meshing.cfg] from your KAMP_SETTINGS.cfg</li> <li>Instead KAMP has been integrated into Klipper as of January 2024 and you should use the ADAPTIVE=1 option in your BED_MESH_CALIBRATION calls. You can find more Information on Adaptive Mesh Here</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Extruders.html","title":"Extruders","text":""},{"location":"H2%20V2S%20Lite%20Revo.html","title":"H2 V2S Lite Revo","text":""},{"location":"H2%20V2S%20Lite.html","title":"H2 V2S Lite","text":""},{"location":"H2%20V2S%20Revo.html","title":"H2 V2S Revo","text":""},{"location":"H2%20V2S.html","title":"H2 V2S","text":""},{"location":"H2%20V2X.html","title":"H2 V2X","text":"<p>Product Link:</p> <p>https://biqu.equipment/products/h2-v2x</p> <p>Wiki link\uff1a</p> <p>https://bttwiki.com/H2%20V2X.html</p> <p>Github Link:</p> <p>https://github.com/bigtreetech/H2-V2X</p>"},{"location":"H2%20V2X.html#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>The H2 V2X is an ultra-lightweight (145g) direct drive extruder, crafted from anodized aluminum with CNC precision.

If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver.</p> <p>If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number.

Alternately you can compile your own version using VScode. Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below:</p> <p>\u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html</p> <p>\u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I</p> <p>Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below:</p> <ol> <li>Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d. Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader.</li> <li>Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/</li> <li>Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card.</li> <li>Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it.</li> <li>Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d.

They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard.</p> <ul> <li>Never work on the motherboard with power applied.</li> <li>Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with.</li> <li>The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET.</li> <li>Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard.</li> <li>It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card.</li> <li>The stock Octopus does not come with a INA826AIDR amplifier chip. If you want to use the PT100 interface, you need to purchase a INA826AIDR chip (SOP-8 Package) separately and solder the chip into the correct position as shown below.</li> </ul> <p></p> <ul> <li>The silkscreen on the first production run of the octopus had incorrectly labeled pins on the connectors listed below.

Bigtreetech will monitor all beta firmware versions, and if we find a firmware version that affects Panda Touch functionality, we will send out an alert via email, Aliexpress chat, and our social channels. Buyers can then decide whether or not they would like to perform the update at the risk of losing functionality. Note that the Panda Touch warranty does not cover lost functionality due to a Bambu Lab firmware update being performed.</p> <p>Certain features of the Panda Touch, including initiating printing, controlling the motion system, adjusting temperatures, controlling fans, AMS settings/calibration, are likely to be affected by the authorization and authentication protection mechanisms in Bambu Lab's newly announced firmware which is currently only released for the X1 series. If using an X1 in cloud mode, these features may be unavailable. However, the ability to access printer status information, such as printing progress, nozzle temperature, and bed temperature, will remain unaffected while in cloud mode. To regain full control of X1 machines (or any machine with the new authentication firmware) when using the Panda Touch, you can manually enable Developer Mode under the LAN mode section.</p> <p>For more details, please refer to the official announcements by BIQU and Bambu Lab: 1. https://bigtree-tech.com/blogs/news/announcement-on-bambu-lab-security-firmware-update 2. https://blog.bambulab.com/firmware-update-introducing-new-authorization-control-system-2/ 3. https://blog.bambulab.com/updates-and-third-party-integration-with-bambu-connect/</p>"},{"location":"Panda%20Touch.html#important-usage-information","title":"IMPORTANT USAGE INFORMATION","text":"<ul> <li>When using \"LAN Only\" mode on a P1P or P1S, there is no need to connect the Panda Touch to a cloud account, and all printer functions will be available on the Panda Touch.</li> <li>When the printer is set to connect to the cloud, you will need to enable cloud mode functionality on the Panda Touch to retain the ability to control heaters and printing functions.</li> <li>Please check the firmware listing on the product page description to ensure that your printer firmware is compatible with the Panda Touch. Updating printer firmware to an incompatible version that may limit the functionality of the Panda Touch is not covered under the warranty.</li> <li>MicroSD card and USB drive files can currently only be read from the root directory and will only be recognized when models are sliced in Build Plate #1 in Bambu Studio and are in 3mf format. Folder browsing and thumbnail previews will come in a future firmware release.</li> <li>When running on its built-in lithium battery, the Panda Touch has a battery life of approximately 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the screen brightness. To maintain the battery and extend the lifespan of the product, it is advised to charge the Panda Touch or turn it off as soon as the battery runs out.</li> <li>The screen may flicker when the lithium battery is low on power. This flickering is normal and acts as a warning to users that the battery is almost empty. Users should then promptly charge the battery or turn off the Panda Touch.</li> <li>If you plan to turn your printer on and off frequently, we recommend running the Panda Touch on DC5V mode.

If the Panda Touch is removed from the dock then the battery will take over and power it for up to 30 minutes. Upon being returned to the dock, the USB will once again resume charging and powering the Panda Touch. This mode is recommended for users who do not turn their printer on and off often. Note that there is no battery charge level indicator. The Panda Touch has been designed for brief periods of use away from a dock and not for prolonged mobile use.   * When switched to the <code>DC 5V</code> position, the Panda Touch is powered directly from the USB input, while still charging the battery. Removing it from the dock will power it off without the Panda Touch draining the battery.

This is only relevant if you are crafting your own, custom, transparent GIFs.</li> <li>The size of a single GIF cannot exceed 1.5MB (1536KB, 1MB=1024KB), and the total size of all GIFs cannot exceed 3MB (3072KB, 1MB=1024KB).</li> <li>The new GIF size must not exceed the sum of the replaced GIF size and remaining capacity. Otherwise, the Web UI will reject the replacement. You can check the available capacity in \u2463 and the size of each GIF in \u2464. For example:\u2002\u00a0to replace \u201cStandby.gif,\u201d if the factory GIF size is 63.61KB and the remaining capacity is 407.75KB, the new GIF size cannot exceed 63.61KB + 407.75KB = 471.36KB.</li> </ul> </li> <li>\u2465 Download and Export Custom GIF as IMG File, Conveniently backup or share your custom GIF designs. <p>Note: As of firmware V1.0.2 the IMG does not include custom color data information, only GIF image data.

Divide the fan speed at this point by 100 and enter it into the max_power parameter.\n\n# This parameter defines the maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the pin may be set to. \n\n# The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. \n\n# This setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to the fan. \n\n# If this value is less than 1.0, then fan speed requests will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if max_power is 0.9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested, then the fan power will be set to 72%).\n\nshutdown_speed: 0 \n\n# The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if \n\n# The microcontroller software enters an error state. \n\n# The default is 0.\n\ncycle_time: 0.005 \n\n# The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the fan. \n\n# It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software-based PWM. \n\n# The default is 0.010 seconds.\n\nhardware_pwm: False \n\n# Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. \n\n# Most fans do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at very high speeds. \n\n# When using hardware PWM, the actual cycle time is constrained by the implementation and may be significantly different than the requested cycle_time. \n\n# The default is False.\n\nkick_start_time: 0.100 \n\n# Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan spinning). \n\n# The default is 0.100 seconds.\n\noff_below: 0.1 \n\n# The blower will not spin with the included brushless driver when the duty cycle is below 8%. When scaled with Max_power at 0.8, the off_below parameter should be set to 0.1. \n\n# To calibrate this setting, gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. \n\n# Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 8% -&gt; 0.08/Max_power -&gt; 0.08/0.8 -&gt; 0.1) or slightly higher. \n\n# This parameter is the minimum input speed that will power the fan (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0). \n\n# When a speed lower than off_below is requested, the fan will instead be turned off. \n\n# This setting may be used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure effective kick starts. \n\n# To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the fan spinning. \n\n# Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. \n\n# Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 12% -&gt; 0.12) or slightly higher.\n\n#Tachometer_pin:\n\n# Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed.

This parameter must be provided.\n\nmax_power: 0.8 \n\n# This should be set to 0.8 on most motherboards to give full range of control to your slicer. \n\n# Anything above 80% duty cycle will be full power on this particular brushless driver.\n\n# To fine-tune the max_power parameter for your particular motherboard, set max_power to 1.0, go into the Klipper dashboard, and increase fan speed 1% at a time until the actual fan speed stops increasing as you increase the fan speed. Divide the fan speed at this point by 100 and enter it into the max_power parameter.\n\n# This parameter defines the maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the pin may be set to. \n\n# The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. \n\n# This setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to the fan. \n\n# If this value is less than 1.0, then fan speed requests will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if max_power is 0.9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested, then the fan power will be set to 72%).\n\nshutdown_speed: 0 \n\n# The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if \n\n# The microcontroller software enters an error state. \n\n# The default is 0.\n\ncycle_time: 0.005 \n\n# The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the fan. \n\n# It is recommended this be 10 milliseconds or greater when using software-based PWM. \n\n# The default is 0.010 seconds.\n\nhardware_pwm: False \n\n# Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. \n\n# Most fans do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at very high speeds. \n\n# When using hardware PWM, the actual cycle time is constrained by the implementation and may be significantly different than the requested cycle_time. \n\n# The default is False.\n\nkick_start_time: 0.100 \n\n# Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan spinning). \n\n# The default is 0.100 seconds.\n\noff_below: 0.1 \n\n# The blower will not spin with the included brushless driver when the duty cycle is below 8%. When scaled with Max_power at 0.8, the off_below parameter should be set to 0.1. \n\n# To calibrate this setting, gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. \n\n# Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 8% -&gt; 0.08/Max_power -&gt; 0.08/0.8 -&gt; 0.1) or slightly higher. \n\n# This parameter is the minimum input speed that will power the fan (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0). \n\n# When a speed lower than off_below is requested, the fan will instead be turned off. \n\n# This setting may be used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure effective kick starts. \n\n# To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the fan spinning. \n\n# Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that reliably drives the fan without stalls. \n\n# Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 12% -&gt; 0.12) or slightly higher.\n\n#Tachometer_pin:\n\n# Tachometer input pin for monitoring fan speed. A pullup is generally required. \n\n# This parameter is optional.\n\n#Tachometer_ppr: 1\n\n# When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the number of pulses per revolution of the tachometer signal.\n\n#Tachometer_poll_interval: 0.0005\n\n# When tachometer_pin is specified, this is the polling period of the tachometer pin, in seconds. \n\n# The default is 0.0015, which is fast enough for fans below 10,000 RPM at 2 PPR. \n\n# This must be smaller than 30/(tachometer_ppr*rpm), with some margin, where rpm is the \n\n# maximum speed (in RPM) of the fan.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"locales/zh_Hans/Universal%20Turbo%20Kit.html#marlin","title":"Marlin","text":"<p>\u542f\u7528\"FAN_SOFT_PWM\"\u9009\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\"SOFT_PWM_SCALE\"\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a5\u3002</p>
