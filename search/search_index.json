Set WIFI_SSID as your actual wifi name and WIFI_PASSWD as your actual wifi password, The space character can be parsed normally without additional escape character. For example: WIFI_SSID=\"CB1 Tester\" Overlays Settings \u00b6 After the OS writes to the SD card, there is a FAT32 partition named BOOT , open BoardEnv.txt file with Notpad , Notpad++ or VSCode . Set as required as shown in the figure below. The default value is console=display , This means that the UART0 of CB1 is used as the debugging port by default. We can use MobaXterm to connect to CB1 by UART0 and debug. If klipper wants to use UART0 to control the motherboard, we need to set it to console=serial , now klippe can use UART0 as /dev/ttyS0 . CB1 will automatically identify the HDMI resolution, but if your HDMI screen cannot report the resolution through the EDID normally, we can forcibly specify the resolution of CB1 output by uncomment extraargs=video and set the actual resolution. For example: BTT-HDMI7 resolution = 1024x600: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:1024x600-24@60 BTT-HDMI5 resolution = 800x480: extraargs=video=HDMI-A-1:800x480-24@60 Uncomment overlays=tft35_spi to enable TFT35 SPI screen.

When using CAN communication, you need to see whether it is used as a terminal. If it is, you must plug a jumper cap on the 120R position. When DIY crimping, wire according to the silkscreen, and DIY according to the Pin and Schematic diagrams so as to avoid the power line from being reversely connected or connected to the CAN signal, which will get the module burned. If there's no external power supply during programming via USB port, you need to short the VUSB by jumper cap so as to supply the module with working voltage. The load current of the heater cartridge and the fan interfaces shall not exceed the maximum withstand current to prevent the MOS tube from being burned out. Please pay attention to the precautions in 4.2 Firmware Update to avoid keeping MCU in DFU mode for a long time when the main power supply and hotend are connected. FAQ \u00b6 Q: What's the maximum current for the heater cartridge and fan interface? A: The maximum output current of the heater cartridge interface: 5A. The maximum output current of the fan interface: 1A. The total current for the heater cartridge, driver and fan needs to be less than 9A. Q: Cannot update firmware via USB port? A: You need to make sure that the jump cap is plugged on VUSB, and the indicator light on the board is on.","title":"EBB Series"},{"location":"EBB%20Series.html#ebb-series","text":"","title":"EBB Series"},{"location":"EBB%20Series.html#compile-firmware","text":"1.After connecting to the Raspberry Pi via ssh, type the below sentences at the command line: cd ~/klipper/ make menuconfig Compile the firmware with the following configuration (if the following options are not available, please update the Klipper firmware source to the latest version).

The screen displays important information through the KNOMI UI, such as heated bed temperature, nozzle temperature, leveling status, printing progress, etc. KNOMI is an open-source product, allowing users to customize the user interface and design mounting brackets to fit their specific 3D printer. Main Features \u00b6 KNOMI UI-based display for quick and easy monitoring of printer status User-friendly, wireless communication through WiFi Open-source enables effortless customization and adaptation of KNOMI to various 3D printers with provided 3D model files, while also allowing personalized user interfaces to suit preferences Compatibility with Voron StealthBurner using our custom printed part files Wide input voltage range (DC 5V-24V) for convenient power supply Reserved Type-C port for DIY burning, increasing versatility Full-view screen for accurate color representation from any angle For information about KNOMI structure, please click : KNOMI USER GUIDE.PDF PERFORMANCE COMPARISON TEST \u00b6 DOES USING KNOMI IMPACT YOUR STEALTHBURNER'S PERFORMANCE? We will offer the customized mounting printed part files for you to effortlessly install KNOMI onto your Voron Stealthburner, in which the StealthBurner main body retains the original fan position and incorporates additional vents on the top for enhanced compatibility and optimized heat dissipation. MOUNTING PLATE Prior to starting the installation procedure, it is advised to have these two printed parts readily available. Owing to size limitations and air duct considerations, the Mounting Plate has been engineered with a snap-fit design. This may be prone to damage during repeated disassembly and assembly. It is recommended to print additional backup pieces for convenience. We conducted a comparative analysis measuring wind speed and acoustic energy levels between the original StealthBurner and our customized version featuring vents and KNOMI add-on. The results showed that both versions performed similarly, indicating that adding KNOMI will not compromise the performance of the StealthBurner. PACKING LIST \u00b6 OVERVIEW \u00b6 CONFIGURING WIFI \u00b6 ACTIVATE THE HELLO INTERFACE Power KNOMI using either the Type-C or MX1.25 interface. While KNOMI is powered on, press and hold the BOOT button for 5 seconds. Wait for KNOMI to display the HELLO message then release the BOOT button. Alternatively, following the installation's completion, the BOOT button may be pressed using a slender tool, such as a hex key. COMPATIBILITY Due to device compatibility issues, KNOMI cannot configure networks with WPA PSK encryption.If you encounter an error configuring your network with KNOMI, please check the encryption method of your router and switch it to WPA/WPA2 PSK mixed mode or another compatible mode. CONNECTING TO KNOM 1.Using a Wi-Fi-enabled device, locate and connect to the \u201cBTT-KNOMI\" network. 2.Allow your browser to automatically open the confifiguration page. 3.Input your local area network Wi-Fi credentials and the printer IP address in the designated fields. 4.Select \u201cSubmit\" to save your settings. 5.Upon seeing the submission success page, close the browser. 6.Allow about 10 seconds for the display screen to transition to the standard working interface following a successful network connection. CONFIGURING WIFI KNOMI DISCONNECTED If KNOMI is displaying this interface, it means that KNOMI is disconnected from the printer. This may be caused by the following problems: 1.You have modified the Wi-Fi name or password, causing KNOMI and the printer to be in different network states. To resolve this, press and hold the BOOT button on the side of KNOMI for 5 seconds to enter the \"HELLO\" interface. From there, you can reconfigure the network connection. 2.The printer has a network failure and cannot establish a network connection with KNOMI. To resolve this, try restarting your 3D printer.

For better viewability please consult the PINS.pdf document. Hardware Configuration \u00b6 Note: The octopus-pro packs a ton of features which necessitates many components and connectors. Given the component and connector density it was not possible to include the silk screen for connector labels on the top. We recommend that you snap a picture of the bottom of the board before starting the installation so that you have a label reference on hand. If you forget to do so then you can always make use of the PINS.pdf file available on our github repo . POWER WIRING \u00b6 The octopus pro provides three separate power inputs: motherboard power, motor power, and bed heater power. This allows a user to use several power supplies with common grounds in order to ensure that they are able to provide the required power to each part of their system. The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V. The 12V, 5V and 3.3V rails are made available via various pins on the motherboard. Consult the PINS.pdf document to find a breakout header if you plan to use one of these supply rails. Take note that the 12V rail can supply up to 4A, the 5V up to 8A and the 3.3V up to 1A however, in order to prevent overloading the rails it is not recommended to load them to their maximum capacity since there are already various components on the motherboard which also take their supply from them. Power wiring is as shown below (look on the underside of your board to quickly identify the purpose of each input if the pins file is not on hand). The positive (red) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked +. The negative (black) wire from the power supply goes to the terminal marked -. The polarity (+ and -) is also silk screened onto the underside of the board. Note: DO NOT alter the board wiring with the power on and be sure to get the polarity correct otherwise you can damage the motherboard. MCU POWER JUMPER \u00b6 The Octopus can be powered using the USB-C port by inserting the jumper as shown below. This can make it easier to compile and download firmware directly to the motherboard using DFU mode. If you do not connect this jumper then you must provide the board with power via the main input supply if you would like to communicate via USB-C. Hardware Installation \u00b6 AUTOMATIC POWER DOWN WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2 module, the wiring can be performed as shown in the figure below. Note: Since power will still be supplied to the Relay 1.2 module after it has cut power to the motherboard, it is extremely dangerous to touch the it while the printer is still connected to mains. Always remove all mains power when working on this wiring. BL TOUCH WIRING \u00b6 When using a BL Touch, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. POWER LOSS RECOVERY MODULE WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH mini UPS, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. RGB LED WIRING \u00b6 When using the motherboard with RGB LEDs you should wire them as shown in the image below. The exact pinout of the connector can be found on the silkscreen on the underside of the motherboard. RASPBERRY PI WIRING \u00b6 The motherboard supports a connection to a Raspberry Pi for printing. There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each. It is beyond the scope of this manual to detail exactly how to connect the raspberry pi to either of these headers however there is an abundance of material online that explains how to interface a raspberry pi to an external device over either of these serial busses. 5V power for the raspberry pi is provided via the dedicated Raspberry pi header (UART2). Consult the PINS.pdf document for the exact pinout of this header. PROBE PORT WIRING \u00b6 The probe port has been provided to allow users to interface bed probes directly to the motherboard without the need for a BAT85 diode to act as a protection against high voltages. The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add a jumper to activate the internal 12k pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows where the jumper to activate the 12k pull up resistor is located. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal. Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin (PC5). Refer to Section 4.2 for further information on how to configure the voltage used by the probe port. STEPPER DRIVER OPERATIONAL MODES \u00b6 STEP/DIR MODE \u00b6 If you are using drivers that do not support configuration over a serial port then you will need to operate them in step/dir mode and set the jumpers beneath the stepper driver according to the microstepping you desire. Each driver will have its own microstepping table so we do not attempt to speak on behalf of the driver manufacturer in our manual. Please consult the datasheet of your driver to determine what signals need to be applied to the microstepping configuration pins in order to achieve the microstepping you desire. Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates the groups of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below. Note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 5V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if your stepper driver requires 0V to be present on any of the pins then there is actually no need to connect a jumper to that pin when running in step/dir mode and connecting a jumper in this instance could cause interference since those lines are used for the SPI bus. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP. For details, please click: https://z1996xm.github.io/BIGTREETECH/Tutorials.html UART MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in UART mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as show in the image below. SPI MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in SPI mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as shown in the image below. MOTHERBOARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 MOTOR POWER SELECTION JUMPERS \u00b6 Each motor driver on the octopus pro can have the voltage used by it configured via a jumper. Note: Before powering your octopus pro, always double check the driver voltage jumpers to ensure that the correct voltage is being routed to each driver. Sending a high voltage to a driver that is not rated for it is likely to destroy it and may even cause damage to the motherboard. Setting the jumper for any given driver to the right, as shown in the image below, will provide the motherboard input voltage for that driver to use. Generally the motherboard uses 24V. Setting the jumper for any given driver to the left, as shown in the image below, will provide the motor input voltage for that driver to use. This can be up to 60V. Note: Never remove or insert a jumper when power is applied to either the board input or the motor input. FAN AND PROXIMITY SWITCH VOLTAGE SETTINGS \u00b6 The Octopus features 6 PWM fan outputs and two \u201calways on\u201d fan outputs. There is also a dedicated pin header for a proximity sensor or probe. All of the fan outputs and the proximity sensor input can individually have the voltage supplied by their pin header selected by configuring the jumpers associated with each header. Configure the jumpers as below to select 24V (note that all are shown in the same configuration even though they can be individually configured). Configure the jumpers as below to select 12V. Configure the jumpers as below for 5V. Note: Since the jumpers carry a voltage rail directly from one of the regulators or from the input, if you short the jumpers in any way other than the shown connections, you will likely cause damage to the motherboard. When connecting the fan, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive output as shown in the images. STALLGUARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 The \u201cdiag\u201d jumpers which are used to connect the diagnostic output pin to the endstop inputs for drivers which support the stallguard feature (TMC2209/TMC2226, etc\u2026) can be found in the location shown in the image below. The exact diag numbering can be found by looking at the pins file or the silkscreen beneath the board. PT100/PT1000 DIP SWITCHES \u00b6 The PT100 amplifier supports 2,3 and 4 wire connections to the board. However, the DIP switch needs to be configured for the setup that you are using. You can find the DIP switch in the location shown in the image below. Note that the DIP switch has switch numbers and the \u201con\u201d position printed on it. Select the connection arrangement for your thermistor according to the table below. Bear in mind that you will still need to configure your firmware using the correct sense resistor values which will be 430\uf057 for the PT100 and 4300\uf057 for the PT1000. 1 2 3 4 Sensor model ON ON ON OFF Two-wire PT100 ON ON OFF ON Two-wire PT1000 OFF ON ON OFF Three-wire PT100 OFF ON OFF ON Three-wire PT1000 If you are using a three-wire arrangement, then you will also need to make a small adjustment to an SMD resistor on the board. The image below shows the factory default resistor setting in the blue box (2/4 wire arrangement). Using a 3 wire arrangement will require you to move the resistor from the blue box into the red box and then to leave the pads in the blue box unpopulated. These resistors are 0\uf057 so if you do not feel comfortable soldering them back in place you can always just create a solder bridge between the pads instead, selecting the pads appropriate to your arrangement. Software Installation \u00b6 COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOTHERBOARD \u00b6 After connecting the motherboard to a computer via a USB cable, the driver will be automatically installed (windows, linux and macos). Upon installation of the driver the motherboard should automatically enumerate as a virtual serial device which can be used for data transfer. If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver. If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number. Other operating systems will list serial ports in a different manner. MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT \u00b6 Marlin, Klipper and RRF (429 variant) all support the Octopus Pro. You can compile and configure you firmware variant of choice according to the methods specified by the developers of that firmware. In time, configuration files for different firmware distributions will be made available on the octopus-pro github . Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below: \u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below: Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d. Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader. Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/ Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it. Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d. This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled for the 446 variant. Take careful note of the crystal oscillator frequency which is 12MHz and differs from the 429 variant. The 429 variant of the board makes use of a different frequency crystal oscillator (8MHz) and therefore the klipper configuration needs to be adjusted slightly as show in in the image below. PRECAUTIONS \u00b6 The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Do not connect a voltage source greater than 28V to this input. Never short circuit the 3.3V, 5V, 12V or 24V supplies to each other. Doing so will let out some smoke and BTT will not be able to put it back for you. You cannot power external devices using the USB-C interface. It is designed for data only. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card unless you reflash the bootloader.

Supports running Klipper and Marlin. Interfaces with a Raspberry Pi using emulated serial over USB or direct UART to any of the serial ports on the board. Supports up to 4 hotend heaters. Provides separate power inputs for motors, bed heating and logic/fans/hotends. Supports 12V or 24V supply inputs (12V only supported on motor and bed. Logic must be > 14.1V) with built in 12V (4A), 5V (8A) and 3.3V (1A) regulators to provide rails for peripheral use. Up to 6 PWM fans and 2 always-on fans with the ability to individually select the voltage rail that will drive each fan. Select from Vin, 12V or 5V. Flyback protection on PWM fan ports \u2013 Many people find that their fan ports become damaged after some time when using larger fans. This is because of the inductance in the fan coils. The octopus includes flyback protection on each fan port which will protect the FETs from damage caused by turning the fans on and off. Includes USB-C interface which supports an emulated serial port that allows printing via USB. Supports all versions of BIGTREETECH TFT screens and LCD12864 screens. Supports multiple languages such as English and Simplified Chinese and can easily switch between different languages (when using the BTT TFT). Includes a bootloader that allows firmware upgrades via the SD card. This offers a simple, efficient, and convenient way to update the firmware. Uses high-performance MOSFETs to increase heating efficiency while also reducing heat generation on the motherboard. Uses easily replaceable fuses Supports \u201cprint from SD card\u201d and \u201cprint via USB OTG\u201d using the integrated USB-A port. Provides two stepper outputs, connected in parallel, to the Z driver allowing for a parallel, dual Z axis drive. Supports firmware update via DFU mode. This is where the firmware is sent to the board directly from the PC and does not require a bootloader however this method is not recommended for novice users as discussed later in this document. Includes an onboard, 32K EEPROM (AT24C32). Provides an RGB LED interface. Provides a WiFi interface for ESP8266 based modules. Provides a DIY PT100 interface. In order to enable the interface a user would need to purchase an INA826AIDR amplifier in the SPO 8 package separately and solder it in place on the board. The connector and passive circuitry are already provided. All that is required is the amplifier IC. Thermistor input protection. This allows you to short a thermistor input directly to a voltage source (not that this makes it a good habit to pick up) up to Vin without causing damage to the motherboard. Allows unused thermistor inputs to be used as general purpose inputs by providing an input pin for each that bypasses the protection circuit. Supports BL Touch and various other ABL sensors. Provides a dedicated \u201cPROBE\u201d port for bed probes. This port is internally protected via an optocoupler which means that you don\u2019t need to use a BAT85 diode. Supports CAN BUS using a 6P6C RJ11 interface, which offers the board the ability to interface with future expansion modules. Supports StallGuard for sensorless homing with TMC drivers Provides an SPI expansion port which can connect the SPI-based expansion modules such as MAX31865 module.

This allows a user to use several power supplies with common grounds in order to ensure that they are able to provide the required power to each part of their system. The motherboard power is regulated using a number of switch-mode and low dropout power supplies to provide the supply rails of 12V, 5V and 3.3V.

MCU POWER JUMPER \u00b6 The Octopus can be powered using the USB-C port by inserting the jumper as shown below. This can make it easier to compile and download firmware directly to the motherboard using DFU mode. If you do not connect this jumper then you must provide the board with power via the main input supply if you would like to communicate via USB-C Hardware Installation \u00b6 AUTOMATIC POWER DOWN WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH Relay V1.2 module, the wiring can be performed as shown in the figure below. Note: Since power will still be supplied to the Relay 1.2 module after it has cut power to the motherboard, it is extremely dangerous to touch the Relay 1.2 module while the printer is still connected to mains. Always remove all mains power when working on this wiring. BL TOUCH WIRING \u00b6 When using a BL Touch, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. POWER LOSS RECOVERY MODULE WIRING \u00b6 When using the BIGTREETECH mini UPS, wire it to the motherboard as shown in the figure below. As always, never perform any work on the motherboard with power applied. RGB LED WIRING \u00b6 When using the motherboard with RGB LEDs you should wire them as shown in the image below. The exact pinout of the connector can be found on the silkscreen on the underside of the motherboard. RASPBERRY PI WIRING \u00b6 Note: The 3.3V and GND pins for the SPI3 port were erroneously swapped on the silkscreen on the underside of some early boards. To be sure of the exact pinout please reference the PIN.pdf document for the SPI3 port. The motherboard supports a connection to a Raspberry Pi for printing. There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI.

Consult the PINS.pdf document for the exact pinout of this header. PROBE PORT WIRING \u00b6 The probe port has been provided to allow users to interface bed probes directly to the motherboard without the need for a BAT85 diode to act as a protection against high voltages. The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add an external 4k7 pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin in order to get a reading. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows how to connect the external 4k7 resistor when using an NPN probe.

Please refer to the pin configuration instructions for the specific firmware that you are using to find out how to enable a pull down resistor on the probe input pin. STEPPER DRIVER OPERATIONAL MODES \u00b6 Note: The octopus packs a ton of features which means there are many connectors and components. In order to keep the board size to a minimum we placed the stepper sockets close to each other. This means that drivers will have a snug fit. STEP/DIR MODE \u00b6 If you are using drivers that do not support configuration over a serial port then you will need to operate them in step/dir mode and set the jumpers beneath the stepper driver according to the microstepping you desire. Each driver will have its own microstepping table so we do not attempt to speak on behalf of the driver manufacturer in our guide. Please consult the datasheet of your driver to determine what signals need to be applied to the microstepping configuration pins in order to achieve the microstepping you desire. Nevertheless, below you will see a figure which will help you to identify which jumpers correspond to the pins that your drivers will use to configure microstepping and we have additionally included a section in appendix A1 which contains the microstepping tables for some of the most common drivers. This should be viewed as a convenience to the user and we still recommend that you consult the datasheet of your driver manufacturer. In the above image the red rectangle isolates one group of driver pins. For the purpose of running the drivers in step/dir mode the pinout can be described as per the table below (note that this is not the actual pinout but rather a simplification for step/dir mode). Connecting jumpers between the upper two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 0V. Connecting jumpers between the lower two rows will set the middle pin (MS) to 3.3V except for the jumpers in the first column where it will connect SLP and RST. Note that if you are using drivers in step/dir mode that use a microstepping factor other than 16 then you cannot use any other drivers in SPI mode since the pins that are required to set the microstepping to anything other than 16 are also shared with SPI. Note that if you use an A4988 or a DRV8825 driver, you must connect RST and SLP. For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html UART MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in UART mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as show in the image below. SPI MODE \u00b6 When using a driver in SPI mode, connect the jumpers beneath that driver as shown in the image below. MOTHERBOARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 FAN AND PROXIMITY SWITCH SETTINGS \u00b6 The Octopus features 6 PWM fan outputs and two \u201calways on\u201d fan outputs. There is also a dedicated pin header for a proximity sensor. These headers are shown in the image below. Note: The polarity of the fan ports was erroneously swapped on the silkscreen on the underside of some early boards. To be sure of the correct polarity, please consult the PINS.pdf document or see the images below. All of the fan outputs and the proximity sensor input can individually have the voltage supplied by their pin header selected by configuring the jumpers associated with each header. Configure the jumpers as below to select 12V. Configure the jumpers as below for 5V. Note: Since the jumpers carry a voltage rail directly from one of the regulators or from the input, if you short the jumpers in any way other than the shown connections, you will likely cause damage to the motherboard. When connecting the fan, make sure that you connect the positive terminal to the positive output as shown in the images. STALLGUARD JUMPER SETTINGS \u00b6 The \u201cdiag\u201d jumpers which are used to connect the diagnostic output pin to the endstop inputs for drivers which support the stallguard feature (TMC2209/TMC2226) can be found in the location shown in the image below. The exact diag numbering can be found by looking at the pins file or the silkscreen beneath the board. SPECIAL NOTE ON EXPANSION INTERFACES \u00b6 Expansion interfaces are provided for SPI, UART and I2C. In the very first production run of the Octopus the silkscreen on the underside of the PCB had two pins that were mislabeled on the SPI3 interface and two on the Raspberry Pi UART interface. To be sure that you are connecting your peripheral correctly, please refer to the PINS.pdf document if using the SPI or UART interface. Software Installation \u00b6 COMMUNICATING WITH THE MOTHERBOARD \u00b6 After connecting the motherboard to a computer via a USB cable, the driver will be automatically installed (windows, linux and macos). Upon installation of the driver the motherboard should automatically enumerate as a virtual serial device which can be used for data transfer. If it fails to do so, you can visit our GitHub website: https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and find the corresponding repository to download the driver. If you would like to confirm that the driver has been installed correctly you can access the device manager in windows and look for a virtual com port when the motherboard is plugged in. In the image below the motherboard has been assigned COM7 however your operating system may assign it any available COM port number. Other operating systems will list serial ports in a different manner. MOTHERBOARD FIRMWARE SUPPORT \u00b6 You can find a pre-compiled version of Marlin for the Octopus by visiting https://github.com/bigtreetech?tab=repositories and looking for the Octopus repository. Alternately you can compile your own version using VScode. Covering how to compile firmware using VSCode is beyond the scope of this manual however there is an abundance of information online which explains how to set up VSCode on your machine and how to configure Marlin thereafter. Good places to start are provided for your convenience in the links below: \u2022 https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_platformio_vscode.html \u2022 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq_ygvHF29I Once you have either compiled your own version of Marlin or downloaded a pre-compiled version, you can install it by following the steps below: Make sure that the firmware binary is named \u201cfirmware.bin\u201d. Any other name will be rejected by the bootloader. Use an SD card that has been formatted using the SD formatter tool here: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/ Copy the firmware binary file to the SD card. Insert the SD card into the motherboard and reset it. Remove the SD card and check that the file has changed name to \u201cFIRMWARE.CUR\u201d. This will confirm that the firmware was successfully installed. If you are using Klipper then please ensure that you have the following settings enabled in order to download the firmware to the board while preserving the factory bootloader: PRECAUTIONS \u00b6 The precautions listed in this section should not be overlooked. They have been included as reminders to prevent damage to your motherboard. Never work on the motherboard with power applied. Always double check all jumpers and wiring before applying power. Improper jumpers or wiring can cause damage to the motherboard and possibly even peripherals that it interfaces with. The motherboard can power heated beds up to 300W. If you are using a bed that operates at a higher power then you will need to use an external MOSFET. Always consult the PIN.pdf diagram when making jumper connections or wiring changes. Assuming a connection order may result in damage to the motherboard. It is recommended to update the firmware using SD card. Using DFU (direct programming via the USB port) will overwrite the bootloader meaning that you will no longer have the option to update via SD card. The stock Octopus does not come with a INA826AIDR amplifier chip. If you want to use the PT100 interface, you need to purchase a INA826AIDR chip (SOP-8 Package) separately and solder the chip into the correct position as shown below. The silkscreen on the first production run of the octopus had incorrectly labeled pins on the connectors listed below. To be sure that you are wiring on the correct pins please use the PINS.pdf document when using any of these connectors. The silkscreen has been corrected and all subsequent Octopus boards will reflect the correct mapping. a. Fans b. SPI3 c. Raspberry pi UART.

Supports running Klipper and Marlin. Interfaces with a Raspberry Pi using emulated serial over USB or direct UART to any of the serial ports on the board. Supports up to 4 hotend heaters. Provides separate power inputs for motors, bed heating and logic/fans/hotends. Supports 12V or 24V supply inputs (12V only supported on motor and bed. Logic must be > 14.1V) with built in 12V (4A), 5V (8A) and 3.3V (1A) regulators to provide rails for peripheral use. Up to 6 PWM fans and 2 always-on fans with the ability to individually select the voltage rail that will drive each fan. Select from Vin, 12V or 5V. Flyback protection on PWM fan ports \u2013 Many people find that their fan ports become damaged after some time when using larger fans. This is because of the inductance in the fan coils. The octopus includes flyback protection on each fan port which will protect the FETs from damage caused by turning the fans on and off. Includes USB-C interface which supports an emulated serial port that allows printing via USB. Supports all versions of BIGTREETECH TFT screens and LCD12864 screens. Supports multiple languages such as English and Simplified Chinese and can easily switch between different languages (when using the BTT TFT). Includes a bootloader that allows firmware upgrades via the SD card. This offers a simple, efficient, and convenient way to update the firmware. Uses high-performance MOSFETs to increase heating efficiency while also reducing heat generation on the motherboard. Uses easily replaceable fuses Supports \u201cprint from SD card\u201d and \u201cprint via USB OTG\u201d using the integrated USB-A port. Provides two stepper outputs, connected in parallel, to the Z driver allowing for a parallel, dual Z axis drive. Supports firmware update via DFU mode. This is where the firmware is sent to the board directly from the PC and does not require a bootloader however this method is not recommended for novice users as discussed later in this document. Includes an onboard, 32K EEPROM (AT24C32). Provides an RGB LED interface. Provides a WiFi interface for ESP8266 based modules. Provides a DIY PT100 interface. In order to enable the interface a user would need to purchase an INA826AIDR amplifier in the SPO 8 package separately and solder it in place on the board. The connector and passive circuitry are already provided. All that is required is the amplifier IC. Thermistor input protection. This allows you to short a thermistor input directly to a voltage source (not that this makes it a good habit to pick up) up to Vin without causing damage to the motherboard. Allows unused thermistor inputs to be used as general purpose inputs by providing an input pin for each that bypasses the protection circuit. Supports BL Touch and various other ABL sensors. Provides a dedicated \u201cPROBE\u201d port for bed probes. This port is internally protected via an optocoupler which means that you don\u2019t need to use a BAT85 diode. Supports CAN BUS using a 6P6C RJ11 interface, which offers the board the ability to interface with future expansion modules. Supports StallGuard for sensorless homing with TMC drivers Provides an SPI expansion port which can connect the SPI-based expansion modules such as MAX31865 module. Supports the shutdown after printing function. Supports the power loss print resume function Includes inputs for up to 6 endstop switches and 2 filament runout interfaces.

There are several connection options available to connect to a raspberry pi. Simplest of all is to connect the raspberry pi directly to the USB-C port which will emulate a virtual serial port on the pi. However, if you have another need for the USB-C port you are still able to connect the raspberry pi to the motherboard using a direct serial connection over UART or SPI. Dedicated UART and SPI pin headers have been made available on the motherboard for this purpose with the pin mappings conveniently printed in silkscreen on the underside of the board for each.

The probe signal pin connects to an internal optocoupler that in turn triggers the pin connected to the microcontroller. Depending on the type of probe you are using, you may need to add an external 4k7 pull up resistor between the probe positive voltage rail and the probe signal pin in order to get a reading. This will be the case if you are using an \u201cNPN\u201d style probe where the output pulls to ground when it is active. You can tell this by checking the output of your probe using a multimeter. If it floats when it is not active (with nothing else connected to it) and then goes to ground when it is active, it is an NPN style probe. If it goes to the positive rail when active then it is a PNP style probe. The image below shows how to connect the external 4k7 resistor when using an NPN probe. Regardless of the kind of probe you are using, you will need to enable the internal pulldown resistor on the probe input pin in order for it to generate an output signal.

Follow the steps below to replace the KlipperScreen: 1.Open the moonraker.conf file in Mainsail. 2.Change the origin of KlipperScreen from the official https://github.com/jordanruthe/KlipperScreen.git to: https://github.com/bigtreetech/KlipperScreen.git If you want to use the official version instead of BigTreeTech's, simply change the link back. 3.Click the refresh button in the upper right corner of the Update Manager, then Hard Recovery KlipperScreen. 4.Wait for the update to complete. Setting up SPI to CAN As explained in \"Pad 7 Settings\" section, set the overlays to include mcp2515 to enable the CAN functionality automatically after booting. Setting up ADXL345 As explained in \"Pad 7 Settings\" section, set the overlays to include spidev1_1. After booting, the system user space should load spidev1.1. Add the following configuration to the printer.cfg file to use the ADXL345: [mcu CB1] serial: /tmp/klipper_host_mcu [adxl345] cs_pin: CB1:None spi_bus: spidev1.1 axes_map: z,y,-x # Modify according to the actual orientation of the ADXL345 installed on the printer. To Work with a CM4 \u00b6 We recommend using the OS image released by Mainsail: https://github.com/mainsail-crew/MainsailOS/releases The steps for burning the system are the same as with CB1. Setting up Backlight Note: The backlight IO of CM4 does not have PWM function, so it can only be set to maximum brightness. 1.Remove \"console=serial0,115200\" from /boot/cmdline.txt file (if it exists). 2.Remove enable_uart=1 from /boot/config.txt file (if it exists). 3.Add the following lines to /boot/config.txt file: dtoverlay=gpio-led dtparam=gpio=14,label=Pad7-lcd,active_low=1 Setting up Resolution and Touch 1.Add the following lines to /boot/config.txt file to specify the HDMI output resolution: hdmi_group=2 hdmi_mode=87 hdmi_cvt 1024 600 60 6 0 0 0 hdmi_drive=1 Some versions of the system disable USB by default to save power.

A normal situation is shown in the figure. ADXL345 Not Working \u00b6 1.Check the CS-Choose switch inside Pad 7. When used with CB1, it should be set to the CB1 position, and when used with CM4, it should be set to the CM4 position. 2.Check the wiring sequence of the SPI port according to the \u201cConnection between Pad7, EBB36, and ADXL345\u201d section of this manual. 3.In the SSH terminal, execute the command \"ls /dev/spi*\" to check if CB1 has a device named \"spidev1.1\" and if CM4 has a device named \"spidev0.1\". Cautions \u00b6 Do not attempt to hot-swap the TF card. Make sure it is properly inserted before powering on the device. We advise customers not to disassemble the device as they may not be familiar with the internal structure, which can lead to internal circuit breakdown. Any problems caused by disassembling will not be covered by compensation. If you need to replace the core board, follow the replacement steps provided (see \"To Replace CB1 with CM4\" section). When wiring the SPI interface to the expansion module, pay close attention to the silkscreen to avoid short circuits.

Step 1: In the Marlin 2.0 firmware, locate and open the \"Configuration.h\" file, then find the line \"#define MOTHERBOARD XXXXXX\". \"XXXXXX\" represents the model of the board being used. Confirm the motherboard you are using. Step 2: In the Marlin\\src\\pins directory, find the \"pins_xxxxxx.h\" file corresponding to your board (xxxxxx represents the board model), and then locate \"X_CS_PIN\", \"Y_CS_PIN\", \"Z_CS_PIN\", and \"EO_CS_PIN\" within the file. Modify the pin names following these variables to the pins you are using. Step 3: In the file from Step 2, locate \"#define TMC_SW_MOSI XXX\", \"#define TMC_SW_MISO XXX\", and \"#define TMC_SW_SCK XXX\". Change \"XXX\" to the pins you want to use. Step 4: Find and open \"Configuration_adv.h\", then locate \"#define TMC_USE_SW_SPI\" and remove the comment symbols \"//\". Step 5: In the \"Configuration_adv.h\" file, find \"#define X_CURRENT\", \"#define X_MICROSTEPS\", and \"#define X_RSENSE\" and modify the parameters that follow (for each axis being used). The RSENSE value for each used axis should be changed to \"0.022\". Step 6: Set the corresponding axis drive type to \"TMC5160\" in the \"Configuration.h\" file. Klipper Firmware Settings \u00b6 Note: The default sense_resistor in Klipper is 0.075; it needs to be set to 0.022. Precautions \u00b6 Turn off the power before installing the driver to prevent damage. Do not plug or unplug the driver module with power on to avoid damage. Be cautious of polarity when connecting; reversing can cause the driver to burn out. The factory-installed heat sink should not be removed, as doing so will decrease heat dissipation in the absence of thermal interface material. For large currents (greater than 3A), active cooling is required for normal operation. This product uses a 0.022R sampling resistor, so the maximum effective driving current is 10.6A. Pay attention to the power sequence; ensure the driver power is turned on before the logic power. That is, turn on the driver power first, then power on the motherboard. Regardless of whether the driver uses high or low voltage power delivery, the output voltage from the main control board to the drive must not exceed 24V; exceeding this will damage the driver.","title":"TMC5160T Plus"},{"location":"TMC5160TPlus.html#tmc5160t-plus","text":"","title":"TMC5160T Plus"},{"location":"TMC5160TPlus.html#introduction","text":"TMC5160T Plus is a high-power stepper motor driver control module, featuring 8 high-power MOSFETs separately mounted on the board with a maximum voltage of 60V.

Do not plug or unplug the driver module with power on to avoid damage. Be cautious of polarity when connecting; reversing can cause the driver to burn out. The factory-installed heat sink should not be removed, as doing so will decrease heat dissipation in the absence of thermal interface material. For large currents (greater than 3A), active cooling is required for normal operation. This product uses a 0.022R sampling resistor, so the maximum effective driving current is 10.6A. Pay attention to the power sequence; ensure the driver power is turned on before the logic power. That is, turn on the driver power first, then power on the motherboard. Regardless of whether the driver uses high or low voltage power delivery, the output voltage from the main control board to the drive must not exceed 24V; exceeding this will damage the driver.","title":"Precautions"},{"location":"Tutorials.html","text":"Subdivision Table \u00b6 COMMON DRIVER JUMPER TABLES \u00b6 These tables are provided as a convenience to the user.
