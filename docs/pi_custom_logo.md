## BIGTREETECH Pi1/CB1 OS before V3.0.0

For Pi1 or CB1 OS version before v3.0.0 refer to GitHub repo [bigtreetech/armbian-bootlogo](https://github.com/bigtreetech/armbian-bootlogo)

## BIGTREETECH Pi1/CB1 OS V3.0.0 and after V3.0.0, and all OS of Pi2/CB2

Use the standard plymouth theme.

<img src=img/custom_logo.webp width="500"/>

Replace `bgrt-fallback.webp` (recommended size is 256*256px) and `watermark.webp` in path `/usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/` in the OS.

``` shell
sudo mv ./bgrt-fallback.webp /usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/bgrt-fallback.webp
sudo mv ./watermark.webp /usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/watermark.webp
```

If you don't like to display `bgrt-fallback.webp` or `watermark.webp`, you can delete them directly by

``` shell
sudo rm /usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/bgrt-fallback.webp
```
or

``` shell
sudo rm /usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/watermark.webp
```

`throbber-*.webp` is a lot of png images generated by the script based on `spinner.gif`. Customization is not recommended. If you don't like this spinner, you can delete it directly by

``` shell
sudo rm /usr/share/plymouth/themes/armbian/throbber-*
```

Update logo by

``` shell
sudo plymouth-set-default-theme -R armbian
```

Wait for the command to complete and then restart.

`sudo apt upgrade` may automatically update the logo to armbian from the internet. If you don't want this, you can use command below to disable the logo update.

``` shell
sudo apt-mark hold armbian-plymouth-theme
```
