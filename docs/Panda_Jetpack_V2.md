## **Introduction**

The Panda Jetpack V2 is a precision-engineered front cover upgrade for Bambu Lab P1 and X1 printers, designed to significantly enhance print quality and performance. It delivers omnidirectional cooling for superior overhangs and fine details, while its optimized mass distribution allows for increased printhead speed and accuracy. Equipped with customizable RGB lighting, it provides both practical print monitoring through visual alerts and aesthetic personalization - all within a sleek, form-fitting design that maintains the printer's original profile.

## **Feature Highlights**

- **Ultra-Light Structural Design**

    Achieves smoother, higher-precision prints by reducing mass and inertia, while its enhanced cooling effectively prevents nozzle clogs.

- **Omni-directional Part Cooling Fan Duct**

    Features a corner-outlet design that distributes airflow evenly. This improves bridging and overhang performance. The compact shape also ensures a clear, unobstructed view of the nozzle and printing process.

- **Precision Injection Molded**

    Provides an enhanced surface finish, resulting in a more visually appealing and premium-feeling product.

- **Web UI Wireless Control**

    Use the intuitive web interface to customize your lighting. Adjust effects, color, brightness, and speed.

- **H2D Style Status Color Indicator**

    Use the vibrant LED lighting to receive instant feedback on device status and dynamic visual alerts for notifications.
