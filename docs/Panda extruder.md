## **Introduction**

The BIQU Panda Extruder is an exceptional durability-focused upgrade for P1P, P1S, X1C, and X1E printers. Crafted from aerospace-grade CNC anodized aluminum, it reduces inertia during high-speed printing, which results in superior print quality. Additionally, its free-flowing ventilation design efficiently dissipates heat, preventing overheating and maintaining consistent and reliable performance.

## **Feature Highlights**

**Enhanced Print Quality:** A lightweight CNC-machined structure consisting of aerospace-grade aluminum makes it light yet sturdy. Reduced inertia with high-speed printing results in superior print quality and finer prints.

**Optimized Heat Dissipation:** The free-flowing ventilation design for exceptional heat dissipation prevents overheating while maintaining smooth operation all round.

**Durability with Style: **Combining aesthetics with functionality, the Panda extruder's vibrant color scheme and corrosion-resistant material offer both visual appeal and lasting performance.

**Drop-In Upgrade:** Compatible with X1C, X1E, P1P, and P1S stock gears. Also works flawlessly with our Panda series accessories such as the Panda Claw, Panda Revo, and Panda Jetpack.
