## Introduction

The BIQU Panda Breeze is an auxiliary cooling fan designed for the Bambu Lab A1 3D printer. Mounted on the X-axis, its crossflow fan provides wide, even airflow across the print surface. This significantly improves print quality by enhancing bridging performance, stabilizing overhangs, and capturing fine details.

## Feature Highlights

**High-Efficiency Crossflow Fan:** Delivers a wide, even stream of air for precise and consistent cooling across the print bed.

**Superior Print Quality:**  Dramatically improves performance on complex geometries, including bridging, steep overhangs, and fine details.

**Integrated LED Light:** Illuminates the print area for enhanced visibility during the printing process, making monitoring easier.

**Plug-and-Play:** Utilizes the printer's existing mounting points and power connections, no hardware modifications required.

**Durable Aluminum Construction:** Built with a high-quality aluminum-alloy body for exceptional strength, durability, and reliable heat dissipation.

## Installation

**Step 1: Mount Panda Breeze**

1、Using a 2.0 mm hex driver, remove the two screws on the back of the X-axis (see reference images).
