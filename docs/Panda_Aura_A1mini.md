## Important Notes

* The Panda Aura product line consists of two dedicated models: the Panda Aura A1 for the A1 printer and the Panda Aura A1 mini for the A1 mini printer. Please be aware that the term "Panda_Aura" is often used as a collective name for both products.

* As the Panda Aura A1 and A1 mini are designed solely to monitor printer status and do not issue commands, their functionality remains independent and will not be affected by Bambu Lab firmware updates. For more information on affected and unaffected features, please refer to the [Bambu Lab Official Announcement](https://blog.bambulab.com/firmware-update-introducing-new-authorization-control-system-2/).

* Panda Aura A1 & A1 mini only support connection to 2.4G Wi-Fi.

* After connecting Panda Aura A1 & A1mini's AP hotspot in the setup interface, the Web UI interface will directly open. Due to permission issues on some phones, firmware uploads may not be possible on this page. Please visit the Web UI in a browser to upload files.

* If you encounter any issues not covered in this wiki, please contact customer support via: `support01@bigtree-tech.com`.

<img src=img/PandaAura/en/list_a1.jpg width="600"/>

#### Installation Steps

* Remove the three screws from the bottom of the A1 printer as shown in the image.

    <img src=img/PandaAura/install_1.webp width="600"/>

* Place the A1 printer on the Panda Aura A1 acrylic base.

    <img src=img/PandaAura/install_2.webp width="600"/>

* Position the A1 printer so that it is centered and both the left and right columns are flush against the rear limit blocks.

    <img src=img/PandaAura/install_3.webp width="600"/>

* For easiest installation, position the device at the edge of your work surface. Then, install the three self-tapping screws from the underside. This method avoids the need to flip the printer over.

    <img src=img/PandaAura/install_4.webp width="600"/>

* Connect the acrylic light board's cable to the port on the bottom of the control box, as illustrated.

    <img src=img/PandaAura/install_5.webp width="600"/>

* To determine the metal sheet's position, hold the control box in its intended location on the printer. Once positioned, attach the sheet to secure the box.

    <img src=img/PandaAura/install_6.webp width="600"/>

* Connect the power cable and the adapter cable, ensuring the clips align.

    <img src=img/PandaAura/en/install_7.webp width="400"/>

    <img src=img/PandaAura/install_7_1.jpg width="600"/>

* Connect the 2-pin plug to the port on the back. When disconnecting, pull from the plug itself, not the cable.

    <img src=img/PandaAura/install_8.webp width="400"/>

* Locate an unused 4-pin MX3.0 power port on the back of the A1 printer. Connect the adapter cable's corresponding 4-pin MX3.0 plug to this port.

    <img src=img/PandaAura/install_9.jpg width="600"/>

#### Powering through Panda Branch Plus

For an alternative power source, or if the printer's MX3.0 port is occupied, you can use the Panda Branch Plus (sold separately). Simply connect the Panda Aura A1's 2-pin MX3.0 plug directly into the Panda Branch Plus.
