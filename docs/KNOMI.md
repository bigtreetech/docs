## **Product Profile**

KNOMI is a mini round screen designed specifically for Klipper running 3D printers, offering users a unique and personalized way to monitor their printer's operation. The screen displays important information through KNOMI UI, such as heated bed temperature, nozzle temperature, leveling status, printing progress, etc. KNOMI is an open-source product, allowing users to customize the user interface and design mounting brackets to fit their specific 3D printer.

## Performance Comparison Test

!!! question
    DOES USING KNOMI IMPACT YOUR STEALTHBURNER'S PERFORMANCE?

We will offer the customized mounting printed part files for you to effortlessly install KNOMI onto your Voron Stealthburner, in which the StealthBurner main body retains the original fan position and incorporates additional vents on the top for enhanced compatibility and optimized heat dissipation.

## Mounting Plate

Prior to starting the installation procedure, it is advised to have these two printed parts readily available. Owing to size limitations and air duct considerations, the Mounting Plate has been engineered with a snap-fit design. This may be prone to damage during repeated disassembly and assembly. It is recommended to print additional backup pieces for convenience.

We conducted a comparative analysis measuring wind speed and acoustic energy levels between the original StealthBurner and our customized version featuring vents and KNOMI add-on. The results showed that both versions performed similarly, indicating that adding KNOMI will not compromise the performance of the StealthBurner.

    <img src=img/KNOMI/KNOMI_IN6.png width="300" class="right-image">
    <h4 id="activate-the-hello-interface">Activate The Hello Interface</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Power KNOMI using either the Type-C or MX1.25 interface.</li>
        <li>While KNOMI is powered on, press and hold the BOOT button for 5 seconds.</li>
        <li>Wait for KNOMI to display the HELLO message then release the BOOT button.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

!!! tip
    <div class="div-table">
        <img class="right-image" src=img/KNOMI/KNOMI_IN7.png width="300">
        <p>Alternatively, following the installation's completion, the BOOT button may be pressed using a slender tool, such as a hex key.</p>
    </div>

    !!! warning
        Be careful not to slip and touch any of the other electronics!

### Connect Knomi to Wi-Fi

!!! note "Wi-Fi Compatibility"
    Due to device compatibility issues, KNOMI cannot configure networks with `WPA PSK encryption`.If you encounter an error configuring your network with KNOMI, please check the encryption method of your router and switch it to `WPA/WPA2 PSK` mixed mode or another compatible mode.

1. Using a Wi-Fi-enabled device, locate and connect to the “BTT-KNOMI" network.

    <img src=img/KNOMI/KNOMI_IN8.png width="300">

2. Allow your browser to automatically open the confifiguration page.

3. Input your local area network Wi-Fi credentials and the printer IP address in the  designated fields.

4. Select “Submit" to save your settings.

5. Upon seeing the submission success page, close the browser.

6. Allow about 10 seconds for the display screen to transition to the standard working interface following a successful network connection.

### Knomi Disconnected

<div class="div-table">
    <img src=img/KNOMI/KNOMI_IN9.png width="250" class="right-image">
    <p>If KNOMI is displaying this interface, it means that KNOMI is disconnected from the printer. 
    This may be caused by the following problems:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You have modified the Wi-Fi name or password, causing KNOMI and the printer to be in different network states. To resolve this, press and hold the BOOT button on the side of KNOMI for 5 seconds to enter the "HELLO" interface. From there, you can reconfigure the network connection.</li>
        <li>The printer has a network failure and cannot establish a network connection with KNOMI. To resolve this, try restarting your 3D printer.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

## Adding Relevant Macros

<img src=img/KNOMI/KNOMI_IN16.png width="450" />

```
[gcode_macro BED_MESH_CALIBRATE]
rename_existing: BED_MESH_CALIBRATE_BASE
variable_probing:False

gcode:
    SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=BED_MESH_CALIBRATE VARIABLE=probing VALUE=True
    BED_MESH_CALIBRATE_BASE
    SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=BED_MESH_CALIBRATE VARIABLE=probing VALUE=False
 
[gcode_macro G28]
rename_existing: G0028
variable_homing:False

gcode:
    SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=G28 VARIABLE=homing VALUE=True
    G0028
    SET_GCODE_VARIABLE MACRO=G28 VARIABLE=homing VALUE=False
```

## Homing And Leveling
KNOMI requires the addition of relevant macros for homing and leveling within the `printer.cfg` file. Access the print control interface by entering the Klipper IP address into your browser, locate the config Files directory containing `printer.cfg`, and insert the following macro 
definitions. Once completed, `save` and `exit`.

## Update Firmware

!!! info "Highlights of upgrading KNOMI 1 to KNOMI 2 UI"
    OTA (Over-the-Air) functionality has been added, allowing users to complete firmware upgrades online simply by dragging the firmware file into the Web interface.

    The WiFi configuration Web interface has been optimized, enabling users to search for and select the desired WiFi connection directly on the Web page.

    The KNOMI 2 UI has been upgraded with a completely new design, added QGL leveling UI, making the display effect more vivid. 

    Fixed the Bug of the print progress percentage, and achieved display synchronization with Mainsail/Klipperscreen.

    Fixed other known bugs.
