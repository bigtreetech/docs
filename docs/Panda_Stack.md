- **Step 4 – Install the Pull-Out Tray**

    Align the tray rails with the main body tracks, then push the tray in fully until it locks into place.

    ⚠️ *Note*: Keep the tray level during installation.
    If it doesn’t slide smoothly, remove it and realign the tracks before reinserting — **do not force it**.

## RGB Strip Installation Guide

*Note*: The RGB Strip is sold separately. To function correctly, it requires the compatible Controller and Power Supply, which are also sold separately.

- **Step 1: Prepare the Controller Box**

    - 1. Print the controller shell in advance.

        <img src=img/PandaStack/Controller_case.jpg width="600"/>

    - 2. Using the four HA M3*10 screws provided, secure the two PCBA boards to the printed bracket. 

        *Note: The bracket is trapezoidal; the Panda Branch board attaches to the smaller side, while the Panda RGB Controller attaches to the larger side.*

        Finally, locate the 4-pin cable and connect it to its corresponding connector on the board, ensuring proper alignment by referencing the provided image.

    - 3. Carefully place the assembled bracket into the printed shell, ensuring the connectors on both boards align with their designated holes and the bracket's mounting holes are correctly positioned with those in the shell. Once aligned, secure the assembly by fastening it with the two M3x6 screws.

- **Step 2: Install the LED Strip**

    - 1. For easier installation, carefully turn the Panda Stack upside-down and place it on a flat, stable surface.

    - 2. Pass the LED strip's connector through the hollow openings on the back of the Panda Stack, as shown in the diagram.

        <img src=img/PandaStack/RGB1.jpg width="600"/>

        Peel off the adhesive backing and apply the LED strip along the edges of the Panda Stack, ensuring it covers sides A, B, and C. Press firmly along the entire length to secure the bond.

        *Note: The product was inverted in Step 1. Please note that the surface shown as the "bottom layer" in the image corresponds to the upper inner frame of the final assembly. Apply the LED strip to this upper inner frame.*

    - 3. Cut the LED strip along the designated cut lines to fit the appropriate length.

- **Step 3: Connect the Controller Box**

    - 1. After securing the LED strip, gently return the Panda Stack to its upright position.

    - 2. Locate the 4-pin cable that was installed in Step 1 and connect it to the LED strip's connector. Ensure the connection is secure by aligning the arrows on both connector terminals.
