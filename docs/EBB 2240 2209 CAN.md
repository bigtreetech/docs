## **Hardware Configuration**

**USB Power Supply**

After the main board is powered on, the Power red light will light up, indicating that the power supply is normal. The VUSB in the middle of the board is the power selection end. Only when USB is used to power the main board, it is necessary to use the jump cap to short connect the VUSB. Main board does not support external power supply through TYPE C.

**Download firmware using DFU**

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_DFU.png width="600"/>

Press and hold the on-board BOOT key to power on the main board, or press the BOOT key and then press the RST key. The chip enters DFU mode. At this time, you can connect TYPE C to the PC and program the main control chip through DFU mode.

## **Hardware Installation**

### **Heating Rod Connection**

The heating rod is connected to the main board through the on-board 5569 2PIN connector, supporting the maximum continuous 5A current output

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_5569.png width="600"/>

### **100K NTC or PT1000 Settings**

1.When using 100K NTC thermistor, it is not necessary to insert the jumper cap. At this time, the pull-up resistance of TH0 is 4.7K. When using PT1000, it is necessary to use the two pins in the red box below the jump cap. At this time, the pull-up resistance of TH0 is 2.2K

**2.Raspberry pie or CB1 updated through DFU**

2.1 Press and hold the Boot button, and then click the Reset button to enter the DFU mode.

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_Software7.png width="600"/>

2.2 Enter `lsusb ` in the ssh terminal command line to query the DFU device ID.

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_Software8.png width="600"/>

2.3 Enter `cd klipper` to jump to the klipper directory, and enter `make flash FLASH_ DEVICE=0483: df11` starts to burn firmware (note: replace 0483: df11 with the actual device ID found in the previous step).

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_Software9.png width="600"/>

After burning, there will be dfu-util: Error during download get_ Status error message, just ignore it.

2.4 After the firmware is burned, enter  `ls/dev/serial/by-id/` to query the serial ID of the device (this ID is only available through USB communication, and this step is ignored in CANBUS mode).

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_Software10.png width="600"/>

2.5 If USB communication is used, after the first burning, it is not necessary to manually press the Boot and Reset buttons to enter the DFU mode when updating again. You can directly input.

```
make flash FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32g0b1xx_0F0033000C504B4633373520-if00
```

Burn the firmware (note: replace `/dev/serial/by-id/xxx` with the actual ID found in the previous step)

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_Software11.png width="600"/>

After burning, there will be dfu-util: Error during download get_ Status error message, just ignore it.

**3.Raspberry pie or CB1 updated via CanBoot**

Refer to the instructions here to download CanBoot project : https://github.com/Arksine/CanBoot

3.1 Enter `cd~` to jump to the home directory, and enter `git clone` https://github.com/Arksine/CanBoot Download the CanBoot project, enter `cd CanBoot` to jump to the CanBoot directory.

**[] Enable Status LED**

**(PA13)  Status LED GPIO Pin**

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_Software12.png width="600"/>

3.3 Enter `make ` to compile firmware. When `make ` is completed, the required 'canboot. bin' firmware will be generated in the `home/pi/kliiper/out ` folder of raspberry pie. It can be downloaded directly to the computer on the left side of ssh software.

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_Software13.png width="600"/>

3.4 The computer uses STM32CubeProgrammer software to burn 'canboot. bin' into the chip.

3.5 Enter `cd~/CanBoot/scripts`, and then `python3 flash_ Can.py - i can0 - q ` Query canbus ID (connect the can line in advance and power on), as shown in the figure below, the UUID of the device has been found.

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_Software14.png width="600"/>

3.6 Enter `python3 flash_ Can.py - i can0 - f~/klipper/out/klipper.bin - u be69315a613c ` is replaced with the actual UUID. Note: klipper.bin needs to be generated in advance, and the **application start offset** of CanBoot is **8KiB offset**, so the **bootloader offset** in Klipper's menuconfig should also be **8KiB bootloader**, as shown in the following figure, which has been successfully burned

<img src=img/EBB2240_2209/EBB2240_Software15.png width="600"/>

3.7 Enter `python3 flash again_ Can.py - i can0 – q ` query. At this time, the application changes from the previous CanBoot to Klipper, which means that Klipper has been running normally

For details, please click: 

https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/EBB%20Series.html#canbus-configuration

## **PRECAUTIONS**

- When the TH0 interface does not use PT1000, the jumper cap cannot be inserted above, otherwise the 100K NTC cannot be used normally
- When using CAN communication, you need to see whether it is used as a terminal. If it is a terminal, you must plug the jumper cap on the 120R position;
- When pressing the DIY wire, pay attention to the wire sequence, and carry out the DIY according to the Pin diagram to avoid the power line being connected reversely or missing from the CAN signal, resulting in the module burning;
- When burning the program through the USB port, if there is no external power supply, it is necessary to use the jumper cap to short connect the VUSB to provide the working voltage for the module;
- The load current of the heating rod and fan interface shall not be greater than the maximum withstand current to prevent the MOS tube from burning.

## **FAQ**

**Q: Maximum current of heating rod and fan port.**

Answer: Maximum output current of heating rod port: 5 A.

Maximum output current of fan interface: 1A, peak 1.5A.

The total current of heating rod+drive+fan should be less than 9A.



**Q: USB interface failed to update firmware.**

Answer: Make sure that the VUSB jumper cap is inserted and the power indicator on the motherboard is on normally.
