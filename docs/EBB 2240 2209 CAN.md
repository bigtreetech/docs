For details, please click: 

https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/EBB%20Series.html#canbus-configuration

## **PRECAUTIONS**

- When the TH0 interface does not use PT1000, the jumper cap cannot be inserted above, otherwise the 100K NTC cannot be used normally
- When using CAN communication, you need to see whether it is used as a terminal. If it is a terminal, you must plug the jumper cap on the 120R position;
- When pressing the DIY wire, pay attention to the wire sequence, and carry out the DIY according to the Pin diagram to avoid the power line being connected reversely or missing from the CAN signal, resulting in the module burning;
- When burning the program through the USB port, if there is no external power supply, it is necessary to use the jumper cap to short connect the VUSB to provide the working voltage for the module;
- The load current of the heating rod and fan interface shall not be greater than the maximum withstand current to prevent the MOS tube from burning.

## **FAQ**

**Q: Maximum current of heating rod and fan port.**

Answer: Maximum output current of heating rod port: 5 A.

Maximum output current of fan interface: 1A, peak 1.5A.

The total current of heating rod+drive+fan should be less than 9A.



**Q: USB interface failed to update firmware.**

Answer: Make sure that the VUSB jumper cap is inserted and the power indicator on the motherboard is on normally.
