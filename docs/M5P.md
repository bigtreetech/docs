## **Product Profile**

BIGTREETECH MANTA M5P is a 32-bit motherboard developed by the 3D printing team of Shenzhen BIQU Innovation Technology Co., Ltd. for Klipper running. It can run Klipper with a core board, which greatly eliminates the mass wiring between the motherboard and Raspberry Pi, and also greatly  saves space in the chassis. The BTB headers are designed on MANTA M5P, so that customers can choose to use CM4 or other solutions, thus solving the insane shortage of Raspberry Pi CM4.

## **Features Highlights**

- 32bit 64MHz ARM Cortex-M0+ series STM32G0B1RET6 MCU.

- The thermistor circuit is protected to prevent MCU damage from shorted heated bed and heater cartridge connections. 

- The CNC fan's voltage is selectable in 24V, 12V, and 5V, no more need for external stepdown thus preventing board damage from user error.

- Thermistor connection supports pull-up resistance value setting using jumpers, no more extra module needed for PT1000.

- MCU firmware can be upgraded via an SD card, or use DFU via Klipper's make flash command.

- BTB connectors are adopted between the motherboard and core board, allowing the choice of other core board solutions in addition to CM4.

- Integrated SPI and UART mode of TMC driver and DIAG pin, easily configurable with jumpers.

- Support filament runout sensor, BLTouch, RGB, etc.

- Replaceable fuse for easy maintenance.

- Onboard proximity switch port, support NPN and PNP type selection, (24V, 12V, 5V) voltage selection.

- Onboard SPI interface for connecting acceleration sensor to enable Klipper's input shaping.

- The new E-FUSE fuse is equipped, which can respond quickly, enhance self-protection ability, and greatly reduce the motherboard burnout caused by short circuits or ignition.

## **Hardware Installation**

### **Stepper Driver**

#### **STEP/DIR (STANDALONE) Mode**

e.g.: A4988, DRV8825, LV8729, ST820, etc., connect jumpers(MS0-MS2) according to the microstep chart.

<img src=img/M5P/M5P_STEP_Mode.png width="600" />

**<font  color="red">Note: RST and SLP must be shorted by jumpers for A4988 or DRV8825. </font>**

For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html


#### **UART Mode of TMC Driver**

e.g.: TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225, etc., place jumpers according to the diagram below, microstep and current can be configured in firmware.

**M5P+CB1: Note the direction, as shown in the figure below:**

<img src=img/M5P/M5P_CB1.png width="600" />

### **Voltage Selection for CNC Fans**

Through the jumper cap, you can set the output voltage to 5V, 12V, or 24V.

**<font  color="red">Note: We are not responsible for fan burnout caused by incorrect voltage selection. </font>**

Please confirm the voltage the fan supports before selecting the voltage.

### **100K NTC or PT1000 Setting**

When using 100K NTC, no jumpers need to be connected, the pull up resistance of TH0-TH3 is 4.7K 0.1%. When using PT1000, the pins indicated in the picture below need to be connected via jumpers, parallel connection of 4.12K 0.1% resistors, the pull-up resistance of TH0-TH1 is 2.2K. (This  	    	 	method has a much lower accuracy than the MAX31865 in reading temperature.)

## **FAQs**

- All unplugging and plugging operations should be performed under the condition of power off, including enabling the eMMC writing.
- Pay attention to the heat dissipation of CM4 and CB1. If the running application consumes too many system resources, the CM4/CB1 will get hot quite seriously.
