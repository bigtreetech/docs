## **Introduction**

The BIQU Panda Jetpack is a lightweight printhead upgrade solution designed for Bambu Lab P1 and X1 printers. It upgrades the stock printhead cover and fan duct. It also features a lightweight, hollow design made from durable MJF nylon, which reduces weight and inertia for smoother, more finer prints while enhancing cooling to effectively prevent clogs. Moreover, the innovative air path directs cooling air precisely around the nozzle, significantly improving print quality, while preserving the nozzle's thermal performance, particularly for bridging and overhangs.

## **Feature Highlights**

**Lightweight and Durable Design:** With MJF 3d printed from high-quality nylon, the Panda Jetpack features a hollow structure that reduces weight and inertia, significantly enhancing cooling efficiency and preventing clogs during printing.

**Omni-directional Part Cooling Fan Duct:** Its unique air path design directs cooling air precisely around the nozzle, while preserving the nozzle's thermal performance, optimizing print quality by minimizing issues with bridging and overhangs for smoother, more finer prints.

**Compatibility:** The Panda Jetpack is compatible with Bambu Lab P1 and X1 printers, as well as Panda Revo hotends.
