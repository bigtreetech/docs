## **Product Profile**

BIGTREETECH CB1 is an alternative to Raspberry Pi CM4, which is currently out of stock. <br>BIGTREETECH M4P is a 4-axis motherboard using a CM4 BTB header, which can work with CB1 or CM4 perfectly.

**Product Link:** [BIGTREETECH Official Website](https://biqu.equipment/products/manta-m4p-m8p)

## **Features Highlights**

- DSI1, CSI1 interface (for CM4)

- Gigabit Ethernet interface (1000M for CM4, 100M for CB1)

- 3 USB 2.0 ports

- Equipping the ESD protection chip on the USB and Ethernet ports to prevent being 

  broken down by the static electricity

- When working with Raspberry Pi CM4, its 40pin pin header has the same function 

  as that of Raspberry Pi(Custom IO for CB1)

- Using a BTB board-to-board connection, which can be further reinforced with 

  screws, perfectly compatible with CB1 or Raspberry Pi CM4

- The MCU adopts STM32G0B0RE 32-bit ARM Cortex-M0+ @64MHz chip

- The power chip adopts TPS5450-5A, which supports DC12/24V power input, the 

  output current of the chip is up to 5A, and the peak value can reach 6A, which 

  perfectly supports the power supply of the core board

- The protection circuit of the thermistor part prevents the main control chip from 

  burning due to leakage of the heated bed or heater cartridge

- In CNC fan ports: FAN0, FAN1, and FAN2, a 24V (DCIN) or 5V power supply can 

  be selected with a jumper cap (Note: the voltage of the three CNC fans should be 

  the same, and cannot be set to different voltages individually)

- MCU firmware can be upgraded through SD card, or through DFU with Klipper's 

  make flash command

- On-board TMC-driven SPI and UART working modes, on-board DIAG function 

  pins, can be used by simply plugging and unplugging the jumper cap

- Support filament runout detection, BLTouch, RGB lights...

- Adopt replaceable fuse for easy replacement

## **Hardware Configuration**

**TYPE-C**

<p>After the M4P is powered on, the red LED1 on the lower right side of the motherboard will light up, indicating that the power supply is normal. The J8 on the middle of the board is the power selection terminal, it needs to be short circuited only when the type-C USB is used to supply power to the<br> motherboard or the USB is used to supply power externally. The signal of type-C is connected to the SoC, Only used when writing OS image for CM4 eMMC version.</p>

## **Hardware Installation**

### **Stepper Driver**

#### **Normal STEP/DIR(STANDALONE) Mode**

<p>For example, A4988, DRV8825, LV8729, ST820...use the jumper cap to short MS0-MS2 according to the driver subdivision table.</p>

<img src=img/M4P/M4P_Stepper_Driver.png width="600" />

**<font  color="red">Note: If using A4988or DRV8825, RST and SLP must be shorted with jumper caps for normal operation. </font>**

For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html


#### **UART Mode of TMC Driver**

<p>For example, TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225... Use a jumper cap for each to connect the position of the red box in the figure, and the subdivision and driver current is set by firmware.</p>

<img src=img/M4P/M4P_TMC_UART_Mode.png width="600" />

#### **SPI Mode of TMC Driver** 

<p>For example, TMC2130, TMC5160, TMC5161... Use 4 jumper caps for each to connect the position of the red box in the figure, and the subdivision and driver current is set by firmware.</p>

<img src=img/M4P/M4P_TMC_SPI_Mode.png width="600" />

#### **DIAG(Sensorless Homing) of TMC Driver** 

<p>As shown in the figure, plug the jumper cap when using the Sensorless Homing function, and leave it unplugged when it is not used. There is no need 	to cut the DIAG pin of the driver.</p>

<img src=img/M4P/M4P_TMC_DIAG_Mode.png width="600" />

#### **Driver Voltage Selection** 

<p>The power supply of each driver can be set by the jumper. When the jumper is inserted into the left side, the independent MOTOR POWER port is used for driver power, and the supported voltage up to 56V. When the jumper is inserted into the right side, the main POWER port is used for driver power, and the 12/24v voltage is supported.</p>

**Driver independent power supply**

The jumper is inserted into the left side and powered by the MOTOR POWER port. the supported voltage up to 56V.

<img src=img/M4P/M4P_IPS.png width="600" />

**Main power supply**

The jumper is inserted into the right side and powered by the main POWER port. the 12/24v voltage is supported.

**M4P+CB1：Pay attention to the direction, as shown below.**

<img src=img/M4P/M4P+CB1.png width="600" />

### **40 pin GPIO**

<p>When working with CM4, the pin arrangement of 40 Pin GPIO is exactly the same as that of Raspberry Pi. When working with CB1, it is a custom IO arrangement, as shown in the figure below, the 'GPIO4' in front of '_' is the IO of CM4, and the latter 'PC7' is the IO of CB1.</p>

## **FAQs**

- All unplugging and plugging operations should be performed under the condition of power off, including enabling the eMMC writing.
- Pay attention to the heat dissipation of CM4 and CB1. If the running application consumes too many system resources, the CM4/CB1 will get hot quite seriously.
