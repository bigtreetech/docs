## **Hardware Configuration**

### **Driver Current Description**

The range of driver current depends on the value of the sense resistor.

<img src=img/TMC5160/TMC5160_Cur1.png width="600"/>

The relationship between the effective value and maximum value of the driver current and the magnitude of the sense-resistor, please see the following picture:

<img src=img/TMC5160/TMC5160_Cur2.png width="600"/>

The sense resistors used in the TMC5160-V1.0 is 0.075R, so the effective value of the driver current of this driver is 3.1A, and the maximum current is 4.4A.

If you need to use a larger current, you need to replace the value of the sense resistor yourself (you need to prepare the components and soldering yourself). 

Replace the resistor not less than 0.05R (subject to module size limit).

Note: It is not recommended to replace the resistor. If it must be replaced,the driver will be damaged during the replacement process is at your own risk.

### Marlin Config

!!! note "Marlin version"
    Currently only firmware of Marlin 2.0 and above supports the SPI mode of TMC5160.

Find and open `Configuration.h` in Marlin 2.0 firmware File, and then find `# define MOTHERBOARD XXXXXX` and `XXXXX` Represents the type of board used. Confirm the motherboard you use.

<img src=img/TMC5160/TMC5160_Config.png width="600"/>

Find the `pins_xxxxxx.h` file (xxxx represents the model of the board) in the Marlin `./src/pins` directory, and then find `X_CS_PIN`, `Y_CS_PIN`, `Z_CS_PIN`, `EO_CS_PIN` under the file.Finally modify the following pin name to the pin you use.

<img src=img/TMC5160/TMC5160_Pins.png width="600"/>

Find `#define TMC_SW_MOSI XXX`, `#define TMC_SW_MISO XXX`, `#define TMC_SW_SCK XXX` under the file in Step 2. Modify `XXX` to the pin you want to use.

<img src=img/TMC5160/TMC5160_Pins1.png width="600"/>

Find and open `Configuration_adv.h` and then find `#define TMC_USE_SW_SPI` to remove the comment `//` to enable. 

<img src=img/TMC5160/TMC5160_Configadv_h.png width="600"/>

Under the `Configuration_adv.h` file, find `#define X_CURRENT`, `#define X_MICROSTEPS`, `#define X_RSENSE`. After modification of the parameters (the axes used need to be modified), the `RSENE` of the axes used should be changed to `0.075`

<img src=img/TMC5160/TMC5160_Configadv_h1.png width="600"/>

After the modification of Step 5 is completed, find and open `Configuration.h` and then find `#define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT` modifies the following parameters to set the subdivision, which must correspond to the subdivision of step 5.

Subdivision calculation method, `80, 80, 400, 96` represents 16 subdivisions. If modified to 32 subdivisions, it will be `80 * (32/16), 80 * (32/16), 400 * (32/16), 96 * (32/16)`.

## **Precautions**

!!! warning 
    Always disconnect the power supply before installing the driver to prevent the driver from burning.

    Be sure to confirm the direction of the driver before installing the driver. Prevent the driver from burning due to reverse connection.

    Please do not plug and unplug the driver module when power is on to avoid damage.

    When installing the heat sink, please be careful not to contact the heat sink and the pin header to prevent short circuit.

    The product is sensitive to static electricity, please handle it carefully when using, it is best to remove the package when using.
