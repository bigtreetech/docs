## RGB Ambient Light Installation Guide

> Must be used with [Panda RGB Controller](https://bttwiki.com/Panda_RGB_Controller.html), click to view detailed RGB installation instructions
>
> The following steps should be done after installing the bottom caster wheels.

* Step 1: To secure the light strip, print the required mounting fixture as specified in the design files.


    <img src=img/PandaStation/rgb_3.png width="600"/>

* Step 2: For the enclosed version, begin by removing the silicone plug from the wiring hole, then use the printed fixture to secure the wiring end of the light strip near the fixing point, insert the connector into the hole, and finally route and secure the full light strip along the enclosure using additional printed fixtures as illustrated in the diagram.

    <img src=img/PandaStation/rgb_1.png width="600"/>

    <img src=img/PandaStation/rgb_2.png width="600"/>

    <img src=img/PandaStation/rgb_8.png width="600"/>

    <img src=img/PandaStation/rgb_9.png width="600"/>

* Step 3: For the Panda Station (enclosed version), remove the side panel within the red-marked area (skip this step for the Naked Panda Station), then attach the provided cable management clips to the pillar sides. Insert the longer 4-pin cable (from the package) into the light strip’s connector, ensuring the arrow on the connector is aligned, then route the cable as shown in the diagram and connect it to the upper port on the back panel. 

    Note: The Naked Panda Station does not include the connector board; it must be purchased separately as part of the [Panda Station Enclosure Kit](https://bit.ly/3VzQKoD) or [Panda Station Lighting Kit](https://bit.ly/4mk6yqz). The Panda Station Lighting Kit requires the use of the printed mounting fixtures.
