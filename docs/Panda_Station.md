## RGB Ambient Light Installation Guide

> Must be used with [Panda RGB Controller](https://bttwiki.com/Panda_RGB_Controller.html), click to view detailed RGB installation instructions
>
> The following steps should be done after installing the bottom caster wheels.

* Step 1: Print the fixture for securing the light strip.

    <img src=img/PandaStation/rgb_3.png width="600"/>

* Step 2: Remove the silicone plug from the wiring hole (only available in the enclosed version). Use the printed fixture to secure the wiring end of the light strip near the wiring hole's fixing hole, and insert the connector into the hole. Follow the diagram to attach the light strip around and fix it with the printed fixture.

    <img src=img/PandaStation/rgb_8.png width="600"/>

    <img src=img/PandaStation/rgb_9.png width="600"/>

* Step 3: For Panda Station, remove the side panel within the red line as shown (this step can be skipped for Naked Panda Station), then apply the appropriate number of cable management clips to the pillar sides. Insert the longer 4-pin cable inside the package box into the light strip's connector (make sure the arrow on the connector aligns), then follow the diagram to route the cable and insert it into the upper connector on the back panel. (Naked Panda Station does not have this connector board, it needs to be purchased separately as part of the [Panda Station Enclosure Kit](https://) or [Panda Station Lighting Kit](https://), and the Panda Station Lighting Kit must be used with the printed fixture.)
