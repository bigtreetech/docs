### How to Embed Heat-Set Inserts Using a Soldering Iron

Prepare the 3D printed part that needs to have the heat-set insert embedded.

<img src=img/Panda_Hub/Panda_Hub_Preparation12.png width="500"/>

Place the heat-set insert on top of the 3D printed part, aligned with the cavity designed for it.

<img src=img/Panda_Hub/Panda_Hub_Preparation13.png width="500"/>

Heat the soldering iron and apply gentle pressure. Ensure you push in a direction perpendicular to the surface where the insert will go.

<img src=img/Panda_Hub/Panda_Hub_Preparation14.png width="500"/>

Allow the heat-set insert to slowly melt into the part. Be patient; the slower the insert melts in, the stronger the bond between the metal and plastic will be.

Once the top of the insert is flush with the part, pull the iron back out and let it cool down.
