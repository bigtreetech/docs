## **Introduction**

The H2 V2X is an ultra-lightweight (145g) direct drive extruder, crafted from anodized aluminum with CNC precision. It features superior motor heat dissipation, dual-gear extrusion for smooth filament feeding, and versatile mounting options.

## **Feature Highlights**

- Ultra-Lightweight: Enables faster, precise printing with minimal inertia.
- Superior Motor Heat Dissipation: Hollowed-out, all-metal construction keeps the motor cool for consistent performance.
- Durable Construction: Anodized aluminum with CNC machining ensures long-lasting durability.
- Versatile Mounting: Features four-sided mounting options for expansion setups.
- Effortless Filament Changes: One-handed lock/unlock mechanism simplifies filament handling.

### **Filament Tension and Filament Release**

**Adjusting the Drive Gear Tension:**

The tension of the drive gear is adjustable to allow for the use of various types of filament. Turn the Tensioner Screw counterclockwise to increase pressure or clockwise to decrease pressure. 

Note: Do not force the screw once it stops turning, as this could damage the extruder.
