## **Hardware Configuration**

### **Onboard Indicator Light**

Onboard 2 indicator lights. When powering on, the PWR (red) light will be on when the Raspberry Pi power supply is successfully started, and the ACT (green) light will flash when the system is running.

### **eMMC Version**

1.Install rpiboot

For Windows:

http://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot/raw/master/win32/rpiboot_setup.exe

For Maca and Linux:

https://github.com/raspberrypi/usbboot#building

2.Push the DIP switch 1 (USB OTG) and 2 (RPI BOOT) to ON to enter BOOT mode.

3.Plug the Type-C into the USB port of the computer (in order to avoid problems caused by the insufficient USB power supply of the computer, it is best to use a USB-Hub with an external power supply, or use an external power supply to power the CM4 via the 5V port of the 40 pin pin header). Run sudo ./rpiboot (Mac/Linux) or rpiboot.exe on Windows, then the eMMC of CM4 will be recognized as a mass storage device by the computer (if rpiboot reports an error at this time, you can try to re-plug the USB).

4.The step of using the Raspberry Pi Imager to write the OS image is exactly the same as the LITE version. Note: the SSH function should also be enabled.

5.When the writing is completed, push the DIP switch 1 (USB OTG) and 2 (RPIBOOT) back to OFF to enter the normal working mode.

## **Precautions**

- All unplugging and plugging operations should be performed under the condition of power off, including enabling the eMMC writing function.
- Pay attention to the heat dissipation of CM4. If the running application consumes too many system resources, the CM4 will get hot quite seriously.
- Handle the board gently to prevent damage.
