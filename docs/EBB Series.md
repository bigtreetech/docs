# EBB Series

## **Compile Firmware**

1.After connecting to the Raspberry Pi via ssh, type the below sentences at the command line:

``` shell 
cd ~/klipper/
make menuconfig
```

Compile the firmware with the following configuration (if the following options are not available, please update the Klipper firmware source to the latest 
version).

!!! note 
  NOTE: EBB36/EBB42 VersionV1.0

!!! note 
  NOTE: EBB36/EBB42 VersionV1.1

  <img src=img/EBB36CAN/G0B1/EBB_G0B1_Make.png width="600"/>

!!! note 
  Only after [Klipper Pull request 5488](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/pull/5488) is merged into the main branch of Klipper, will the official firmware support the CAN bus function of STM32G0B1. If you use CANBus communication, you can use the firmware_canbus.bin compiled by us on our GitHub, or use our source code to compile it yourself: https://github.com/bigtreetech/klipper/tree/stm32g0b1-canbus

2.When the configuration is completed, type 'q' to exit the configuration interface. Select "Yes" when asked whether to save the configuration

3.Enter **make** to compile the firmware. The 'klipper.bin' firmware that we need will be generated on the **home/pi/klipper/out** folder of the Raspberry Pi when completed. The firmware is on the left side of SSH software, users can download it directly to the computer.

### <font  color="red">***NOTE: EBB36/EBB42 VersionV1.1***</font>

Warning：STM32G0B1CB needs to jump to the System memory area to runbootloader (written by STMicroelectronics) when using DFU to update firmware through the Type-C port. Referring to the description in manual AN2606

(https://www.st.com/content/ccc/resource/technical/document/application_note/b9/9b/16/3a/12/1e/40/0c/CD00167594.pdf/files/CD00167594.pdf/jcr:content/translations/en.CD00167594.pdf), The initialization process of this bootloader is shown in the following figure: 

<img src=img/EBB36CAN/G0B1/EBB_G0B1_Update1.png width="600"/>

The IO of USART will be configured before going to the USB DFU mode. 

After going to DFU mode, **PA2** will be configured to output high level by bootloader in **System memory** area refer to the datasheet of STM32G0B1CB 

(https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32g0b1cb.pdf)

<img src=img/EBB36CAN/G0B1/EBB_G0B1_Update2.png width="600"/>

**PA2** is used for the hotend MOSFET in **EBB36 CAN V1.1** and **EBB42 CAN V1.1**,The high level in the DFU mode change the hotend into heating state. Therefore, please pay attention to disconnect the main power VIN of the hotend when using the DFU of Type-C port to update the firmware, or ensure that the firmware update is completed soon and goto the normal working mode. Never <font  color="red">***keep MCU in DFU mode for a long time***</font> when the <font  color="red">***main power supply and hotend are connected***</font>.

Upgrade with STM32CubeProgrammer 

1.Open the installed STM32CubeProgrammer and select the firmware to download (klipper.bin).

## **CANBus Configuration**

### **Use with BIGTREETECH U2C Module**

<img src=img/EBB36CAN/072/EBB_072_CANBus1.png width="600"/>

1.Type the following command  `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0`  in the ssh terminal and execute

 `auto can0`

 `iface can0 can static`

 `bitrate 1000000`

 `up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024`

Set the speed for CANBus at 250K (which must be the same as the speed set in the firmware (1000000) CAN bus speed), Save (Ctrl + S) after modification 
and exit (Ctrl + X). Type command  `sudo reboot` to reboot Raspberry Pi.

2.Every device on CANBus will generate a canbus_uuid based on MCU's ID. If users want to find the ID for every microcontroller, please make sure the 
hardware is powered on and wired correctly, then run the following command:

 `~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0`

3.If detected an uninitialized CAN device, the above command will report the device's canbus_uuid:

 `Found canbus_uuid=0e0d81e4210c`

4.If Klipper operates normally and is connected to the device, then it won’t report canbus_uuid, which is also normal.

### **Use with BIGTREETECH RPI-CAN HAT Module**

<img src=img/EBB36CAN/072/EBB_CANBus2.png width="600"/>

1.Type and run the following command  `sudo nano /boot/config.txt`, and added below contents on file config.txt. 

 `dtparam=spi=on`

 `dtoverlay=mcp2515-`

 `can0,oscillator=12000000,interrupt=25,spimaxfrequency=1000000`

After modification, save `(Ctrl + S)`and exist`(Ctrl + X)`, type sudo reboot to reboot Raspberry Pi.

2.Type and run commands `dmesg | grep -i '\(can\|spi\)'` to test if RPI-CAN HAT module is normally connected. The normal response should be as below：

 `[ 8.680446] CAN device driver interface`

 `[ 8.697558] mcp251x spi0.0 can0: MCP2515 successfully initialized.`

 `[ 9.482332] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): can0: link becomes ready`

<img src=img/EBB36CAN/072/EBB_CANBus3.png width="600"/>

3.Type  `sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces.d/can0` on the ssh terminal and runthe command.

 `auto can0`

 `iface can0 can static`

 `bitrate 1000000`

 `up ifconfig $IFACE txqueuelen 1024`

Set the speed for CANBus at 250K(which must be the same as the speed set in the firmware **(1000000) CAN bus speed)**. Save `(Ctrl + S)` after modification and exit `(Ctrl + X)`.Type command sudo reboot to reboot Raspberry Pi.

4.Every device on CANBus will generate a canbus_uuid base on MCU's ID. If users want to find ID for every microcontroller, please make sure the 
hardware is powered on and wired correctly, then run the following command:

```
~/klippy-env/bin/python ~/klipper/scripts/canbus_query.py can0
```

5.If detected an uninitialized CAN device, the above command will report the device's canbus_uuid:

 `Found canbus_uuid=0e0d81e4210c`

6.If Klipper operates well and is connected to the device, then it won't report the canbus_uuid, which is normal.

##  **Klipper Configuration**

1.Enter the IP access of Raspberry Pi in the browser of the computer, and download the reference configuration of the motherboard from the file path 
shown in the figure below. If you cannot find this file, please update the Klipper firmware source code to the latest version, or download it from GitHub: https://github.com/bigtreetech/EBB

2.Upload the motherboard's configuration files to the Configuration Files.

<img src=img/EBB36CAN/072/EBB_072_klipper2.png width="600"/>

3.Add the motherboard's configuration to the file "printer.cfg".

 `[include sample-bigtreetech-ebb-canbus-v1.1.cfg]`

<img src=img/EBB36CAN/072/EBB_072_klipper3.png width="600"/>

4.Revise the ID number of the configuration files as the actual ID of the motherboard (USB serial or CANBus).

<img src=img/EBB36CAN/072/EBB_072_klipper4.png width="600"/>

5.Configure the specific functions of the module as instructed below: https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html

## **PRECAUTIONS**

- When the TH0 interface doesn't work with PT1000, you can't plug a jump cap on it, otherwise 100K NTC won't work.
- When using CAN communication, you need to see whether it is used as a terminal. If it is, you must plug a jumper cap on the 120R position.
- When DIY crimping, wire according to the silkscreen, and DIY according to the Pin and Schematic diagrams so as to avoid the power line from being reversely connected or connected to the CAN signal, which will get the module burned.
- If there's no external power supply during programming via USB port, you need to short the VUSB by jumper cap so as to supply the module with working voltage.
- The load current of the heater cartridge and the fan interfaces shall not exceed the maximum withstand current to prevent the MOS tube from being burned out.
- <font  color="red">**Please pay attention to the precautions in 4.2 Firmware Update to avoid keeping MCU in DFU mode for a long time when the main power supply and hotend are connected.**</font>

## **FAQ**

**Q: What's the maximum current for the heater cartridge and fan interface?**

A: The maximum output current of the heater cartridge interface: 5A.

The maximum output current of the fan interface: 1A.

The total current for the heater cartridge, driver and fan needs to be less than 9A.



**Q: Cannot update firmware via USB port?**

A: You need to make sure that the jump cap is plugged on VUSB, and the indicator light on the board is on.
