## **Product Profile**

BIGTREETECH MANTA M8P is a 32-bit printer motherboard developed by the 3D printing team of Shenzhen BIQU Innovation Technology Co., Ltd. for Klipper firmware. You can simply plug in the core board to run the Klipper firmware, which greatly simplifies the connection between the motherboard and the Raspberry Pi, and saves a lot of space. Moreover, the BTB connector is designed to install CM4 or other solutions to solve the current expensive problem of CM4.

## **Features Highlights**

- Adopt 32-bit 64MHz ARM Cortex-M0+ series STM32G0B1VET6 as the main control chip;
- The power chip, TPS5450-5A, supports DC12/24V power input. The output current of the chip is up to 5A, and the peak value can reach 6A, which perfectly supports the power supply of Raspberry Pi; 
- There is a BOOT button reserved on the motherboard, users can update the bootloader through DFU;
- The thermistor part includes a protection circuit that protects the main control chip from the possibility of burning caused by leakage of the heated bed or heater cartridge;
- 24V, 12V, and 5V voltages are available for CNC fans, eliminating the need for an external transformer module, thereby reducing the chance of damage to the motherboard due to improper operation;
- The thermistor can select the pull-up resistor value through the jumper, in this way, it supports PT1000 without an external module, which is convenient for customers to DIY;
- The MCU firmware can be updated via an SD card, or through Klipper's make flash command using DFU;
- The motherboard and the core board use the BTB connection to allow using other solutions other than CM4;
- On-board TMC-driver SPI and UART working modes, on-board DIAG function pins, can be used by simply plugging and unplugging the jumper cap;
- Support filament runout detection, auto shutdown, BLTouch, RGB lights...
- High efficiency MOSFET for less heat generation;
- Adopt replaceable fuse for easy replacement;
- Three-way four-wire fan interface is reserved, and can be used to connect the water cooling device;
- The proximity switch interface is reserved, supports NPN and PNP types, (24V, 12V, 5V) voltage selection is available, common voltage selection with VFAN6;
- Provide the SPI expansion interface to allow Klipper firmware users to connect an external acceleration sensor for acceleration compensation.

## **Interface Diagram**

<img src=img/M8P/M8P_CAD.png width="600" />

**V1.1 added functions**

CAN interface（2Pin*2 XH2.54），USB port function selection（UART to USB，USB OTG），Pi-FAN（Controlled by GPIO26），FAN4 becomes a 2-wire CNC fan.

<img src=img/M8P/M8P_Add_Func1.png width="600" />

The 5V and 12V power output ports are added with E-FUSE protection, which has short reaction time, strong protection and realizes over-current protection, short circuit protection and spark protection.

## **Hardware Configuration**

**USB Power Supply**

After the M8P motherboard is powered on, the D32 red light on the left side of the MCU will light up, indicating that the power supply is normal. The 	VUSB in the middle of the board is the power selection terminal. Only when using USB to supply power to the motherboard or need to supply power through USB, do you need to use the jumper to short it.

<img src=img/M8P/M8P_USB_PS.png width="600" />

## **Hardware Installation**

### **Stepper Driver**

#### **STEP/DIR (STANDALONE) Mode**

For example, A4988, DRV8825, LV8729, ST820...use the jumper cap to short MS0-MS2 according to the driver subdivision table.

<img src=img/M8P/M8P_Dri_Step.png width="600" />



<font  color="red">**Note: If using A4988or DRV8825, RST and SLP must be shorted with jumper caps for normal operation.**</font>

For details, please click: https://bigtreetech.github.io/docs/Tutorials.html


For example, TMC2208, TMC2209, TMC2225... Use a jumper cap for each to connect the position of the red box in the figure, and the subdivision and 	driver current is set by firmware.

<img src=img/M8P/M8P_Dri_Uart_Mode.png width="600" />

#### **SPI Mode of TMC Driver** 

For example, TMC2130, TMC5160, TMC5161... Use 4 jumper caps for each to connect the position of the red box in the figure, and the subdivision and 	driver current is set by firmware.

<img src=img/M8P/M8P_Dri_SPI_Mode.png width="600" />

#### **DIAG(Sensorless Homing) of TMC Driver** 

As shown in the figure, plug the jumper cap when using the Sensorless Homing function, and leave it unplugged when it is not used.

### **Install the Core Board via BTB Connection**

**M8P+CM4: Pay attention to the direction, as shown below.**

**M8P+CB1: Pay attention to the direction, as shown below.**

<img src=img/M8P/M8P_M8P+CB1.png width="600" />

### **Voltage Selection for CNC Fans**

Set the output voltage to 5V, 12V, or 24V with a jumper cap. Note: Please confirm the fan's operating voltage before choosing a voltage. Our company 	is not responsible for fan burnout caused by wrong selection.

<img src=img/M8P/M8P_CNC_Fans.png width="600" />

### **100K NTC or PT1000 Setting**

When using a 100K NTC thermistor, there is no need to insert the jumper cap, and the pull-up resistance of TH0-TH3 is 4.7K 0.1%. When using PT1000, 	you need to use a jumper cap to connect the two pins in the red box in the figure below and connect a 4.12K 0.1% resistor in parallel. At this time, the 	pull-up resistor of TH0-TH1 is 2.2K (Note: The temperature accuracy read out in this way will be far less accurate than that read out by MAX31865).

## **FAQs**

- All unplugging and plugging operations should be performed under the condition of power off, including enabling the eMMC writing.
- Pay attention to the heat dissipation of CM4 and CB1. The CM4/CB1 may become quite hot if the running application consumes too many system resources.
- M8P V1.1 Notice: If you have an M8P V1.1 and are only able to move stepper motor number 6 in one direction then please contact "bttuniversity" on discord and he will assist you to get the issue resolved. Note that only a limited number of V1.1 boards were affected by this issue and none of the V1.0 boards were affected.
