**How to Lower the Shock-Absorbing Foot Pads for Stable Placement**

1、If you need the printer to stay stable and immovable, you can lower the shock-absorbing foot pads within the castor wheels.

2、Visit https://github.com/bigtreetech/Panda-Under-Armor-PX to download and print the Panda Castor Wheel Adjustment Tool.

3、Use the Panda Castor Wheel Adjustment Tool to pull the red adjustment wheel forward or backward to easily raise or lower the foot pads, allowing the printer to either stay securely on the desktop or floor, or move smoothly when needed.
