## Interface Introduction

### Installation and Interface

Connection methods for common motherboards (e.g., SKR3), use the supplied TMC Driver Adaptor and cables to connect the TMC5160T Plus with SKR3 as shown in the diagram:

!!! warning 
    TMC Driver Adaptor only support 24v!

## Software Configuration

### Marlin Firmware Settings

!!! note "Marlin firmware version"
    Currently, only Marlin 2.0 and later firmware versions support TMC5160's SPI mode.

1. In the Marlin 2.0 firmware, locate and open the "Configuration.h" file, then find the line `#define MOTHERBOARD XXXXXX`. `XXXXXX` represents the model of the board being used. Confirm the motherboard you are using.

    <img src=img/TMC5160TPlus/TMC5160TPlus_Software1.png width="500"/>

2. In the `Marlin/src/pins` directory, find the `pins_xxxxxx.h` file corresponding to your board (xxxxxx represents the board model), and then locate `X_CS_PIN`, `Y_CS_PIN`, `Z_CS_PIN`, and `EO_CS_PIN` within the file. Modify the pin names following these variables to the pins you are using.

    <img src=img/TMC5160TPlus/TMC5160TPlus_Software2.png width="500"/>

3. In the file from Step 2, locate `#define TMC_SW_MOSI XXX`, `#define TMC_SW_MISO XXX`, and `#define TMC_SW_SCK XXX`. Change `XXX` to the pins you want to use.

4. Find and open `Configuration_adv.h`, then locate `#define TMC_USE_SW_SPI` and remove the comment symbols `//`.

    <img src=img/TMC5160TPlus/TMC5160TPlus_Software4.png width="500"/>

5. In the `Configuration_adv.h` file, find `#define X_CURRENT`, `#define X_MICROSTEPS`, and `#define X_RSENSE` and modify the parameters that follow (for each axis being used). The `RSENSE` value for each used axis should be changed to `0.022`.

    <img src=img/TMC5160TPlus/TMC5160TPlus_Software5.png width="500"/>

6. Set the corresponding axis drive type to `TMC5160` in the `Configuration.h` file.

### Klipper Firmware Settings

```
[tmc5160 stepper_x]
cs_pin: PD2
spi_software_sclk_pin: PC6
spi_software_mosi_pin: PC8
spi_software_miso_pin: PC7
run_current: 1.20
sense_resistor: 0.022

```

!!! warning "Check Sense Resistor"
    The default sense_resistor in Klipper is `0.075`. It needs to be set to `0.022`.

## Precautions

!!! warning 
    - Turn off the power before installing the driver to prevent damage.
    - Do not plug or unplug the driver module with power on to avoid damage.
    - Be cautious of polarity when connecting; reversing can cause the driver to burn out.
    - The factory-installed heat sink should not be removed, as doing so will decrease heat dissipation in the absence of thermal interface material.
    - For large currents (greater than 3A), active cooling is required for normal operation.
    - This product uses a 0.022R sampling resistor, so the maximum effective driving current is 10.6A.
    - Pay attention to the power sequence; ensure the driver power is turned on before the logic power. That is, turn on the driver power first, then power on the motherboard.
    - Regardless of whether the driver uses high or low voltage power delivery, the output voltage from the main control board to the drive must not  exceed 24V; exceeding this will damage the driver.
