    </video>

* **Step 1: Form the Main Frame**

    Unbox the left and right side panels (the right panel is marked with the product name), the back panel, and the front bottom bar. Assemble these parts to form the main frame using CM3x4 screws. (Do not fully tighten them yet—tighten after securing the top panel.)


    <img src=img/PandaPerchH2D/3.jpg width="600"/>

* **Step 2: Attach the Top Panel**

    Secure the top panel to the main frame using CM3x4 screws, ensuring the raised side is facing upward.

    <img src=img/PandaPerchH2D/4.jpg width="600"/>

* **Step 3: Install the Bottom Support Bars**

    Install the bottom support bars: the longer one is for the back, and the two identical ones are for the sides. Attach the bars with the folded edge facing upward and inward, as shown in the diagram. After securing the bars, tighten all screws.

    <img src=img/PandaPerchH2D/5.jpg width="600"/>

* **Step 4: Secure the AMS Support Bars**  

    Attach the AMS support bars to the raised horizontal bars on the top panel using CM3x4 screws (horizontal installation). Then, use KM3x15 screws to fix the AMS support bars to the top panel (vertical installation). Finally, secure the reinforcement bars at both ends of the AMS support bars using CN3x4 screws.

## AMS HT Storage Rack Assembly Guide

* **Step 1: Assemble the AMS HT Storage Rack**

    Take out the Storage Rack and the hanging rod. Use the CM4x6 screws to attach the hanging rod to the Storage Rack.

    > Note: For each Storage Rack, use the regular CM4x6 screws to fix the hanging rod to one side, and use the screws with the suction cup to fix the other side. Ensure the suction cup screw is on the side that attaches to the printer, as shown in the image.

    <img src=img/PandaPerchH2D/7.jpg width="600"/>

* **Step 2: Attatch on the Panda Perch H2D**

    Use the CM4x6 screws to attach the Storage Rack to both sides of the Panda Perch H2D main body.

> Note: The AMS HT Storage Rack is an optional accessory. One Panda Perch H2D can be expanded with two sets (two Storage Racks per set, totaling four Storage Racks). If using only one set, we recommend placing one Storage Rack on each side of the Panda Perch H2D (left and right). <br>
**Important:** Always ensure that the suction cup screws are installed at the contact points between the printer's outer wall and the rod and Storage Rack.

## Installing the Panda Perch H2D on the Printer

* **Step 1: Position the Panda Perch H2D**

    After assembling the Panda Perch H2D main body with the AMS HT Storage Rack, we can now install the entire assembly onto the printer. Start by removing the printer’s top cover and positioning the Perch on top.

    <img src=img/PandaPerchH2D/05.jpg width="600"/>

* **Step 2: Apply the Metal Sheet for Securing the Suction Cup Screws**

    Use the round metal sheet from the AMS HT Storage Rack package. Peel off the adhesive backing and surface protection film, then stick it to the area where the suction cup screws will make contact with the printer’s outer wall. (*If the suction cup screws will be attached to the printer's smooth side window, this step can be skipped—no metal sheet is needed.*)

* **Step 3: Ensure Proper Function of the Top Cover Open-Door Detection**

    Attach the two R6x4 magnets from the Panda Perch H2D package to the detection areas on the top cover. <br> *Note: The Bambu Lab H2D Laser Edition top cover has two open-door detection points, one at the front and one at the back. Both need magnets installed.*

## RGB Light Strip Installation Guide

* **Step 1: Print the RGB Light Strip Support Bar and Clips**

    In the print file, locate the RGB light strip support bar and light strip clips, then print them out (it is recommended to use high-temperature-resistant materials like ABS).

    <img src=img/PandaPerchH2D/RGB1.png width="600"/>

* **Step 2: Attach the Light Strip Support Bar**

    Use the CM3x4 screws from the package to attach the light strip support bar to the front bottom bar of the Panda Perch H2D.

    <img src=img/PandaPerchH2D/RGB1.jpg width="600"/>

* **Step 3: Install the Light Strip and Secure with Clips**

    Pass the Power Cable: Carefully pass the light strip power cable through the reserved hole at the back of the Panda Perch H2D.

    <img src=img/PandaPerchH2D/RGB2.jpg width="600"/>

    Align and Stick the Light Strip: Align the light strip along the bottom edge of the Panda Perch H2D. Peel off the protective film from the adhesive backing of the light strip, then press it firmly in place to ensure it sticks securely.

    Trim and Secure the Light Strip: Cut off any excess length of the light strip, following the designated cut points to ensure a neat installation. Then, use the printed clips to secure the light strip along the bottom edge.
