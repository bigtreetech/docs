## User Interface Overview

### First-Time Setup Guide

#### Accessing the Web UI Configuration Page

* Connect to the Creator Knomi Hi AP hotspot
  After powering on for the first time or performing a `Factory Reset`, you’ll see this interface:<br/>
  <img src=img/Creator_Knomi_Hi/ap_qr_code.jpg width="400"/>

    * Scan the QR code on the Creator Knomi Hi to get the AP name and password.<br/> <img src=img/Creator_Knomi_Hi/password.jpg width="300"/><br/>
      Connect to the AP with the default credentials:<br/>
      Wi-Fi Name: `Creator_Knomi_Hi_xxxxxxxxxxxx`<br/>
      Wi-Fi Password: `987654321`<br/>
      > <font size="2">Note: Most modern smartphones are equipped to scan QR codes directly through their camera app. This feature is typically available on devices running iOS 11 or later, and Android 9.0 or later. To ensure optimal QR code scanning performance, please verify that both your device’s operating system and camera app are updated to their latest versions.
      If your smartphone does not have this capability, alternative options include using third-party applications from the application store, like Google Lens. Alternatively, you can manually connect to the  Creator Knomi Hi’s hotspot using the default password `987654321` to access the Web UI.</font>
    * If scanning the QR code doesn't work, you can go to the `settings` menu on the device to connect to the hotspot manually. <br/>Using an iPhone as an example:<br/>
        * On your phone home screen, go to `Settings` → `WLAN`.
        * Turn on `WLAN`. Your device will automatically search for available networks.<br/>
          <img src=img/Creator_Knomi_Hi/wlan.png width="300"/>
        * Tap on the network name starting with `Creator_Knomi_Hi` and enter the default password: `987654321`.
        * After successfully connecting to the Creator_Knomi_Hi network, you will see a blue checkmark next to the network, and the Wi-Fi icon indicating a connection will appear in the top-right corner of the screen.

* Once connected, a `Login Required` message may appear. Tap it to launch the Web UI. If that doesn’t happen, wait 10–20 seconds. If it still doesn’t load, open your browser manually and go to: [192.168.254.1](http://192.168.254.1).

#### Connecting to the Same Wi-Fi as the Printer

* Initially, you will be prompted to select a language. After setting the language, tap `Next` to proceed to the Wi-Fi connection interface.<br/>

### Wi-Fi & IP Settings

<img src=img/Creator_Knomi_Hi/en/wifi_ip.jpg width="300"/>

* ①	Tap the `Wi-Fi & IP` option.
* ②	To change the Wi-Fi network that Creator Knomi Hi connects to, tap `Configure Wi-Fi`, this will take you back to the Wi-Fi configuration interface.
  > <font size="2">Note: When the Creator Knomi Hi switches to a different Wi-Fi network, it will connect to a new local network and IP address. If your device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network as Creator Knomi Hi at the time of this change, you will lose the ability to communicate with it. To reconnect, you'll need to join the new Wi-Fi network to which Creator Knomi Hi has connected. <br/>
However, to avoid losing connection during this transition, it is recommended to connect your device to the Creator Knomi Hi's AP hotspot before initiating any changes to the Wi-Fi settings. This way, you can manage the network settings without disrupting your connection to the device.</font>
* ③	After configuring the network, ensure that your devices (phone, computer, etc.) are connected to the same local network as Creator Knomi Hi.<br/>
Access the Web UI by entering the IP address into your browser’s address bar. To avoid forgetting the IP address, consider bookmarking it on your phone’s home screen.
* ④	Alternatively, if your devices are on the same network as Creator Knomi Hi, you can access the Web UI using the hostname, which by default is `Creator_Knomi_Hi` (accessible via  [http://CreatorKnomiHi.local](http://CreatorKnomiHi.local)  , hostname is not case-sensitive).<br/>Note that if a VPN is active on your device, you may need to use the IP address directly, as accessing by hostname might fail.<br/>Setting the Hostname:<br/>
    * The hostname must consist only of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-), and must start with a letter.
    * The hostname must be at least 8 characters long and no more than 32 characters.  (If firmware is `v1.0.2` or earlier, max is 15 characters to avoid boot failure. To support longer names, update to firmware version V1.0.3 or later.)

    After choosing a new hostname, tap `Set Hostname` to update Creator Knomi Hi. A popup will confirm the successful change. The device must be restarted for the hostname change to take effect. This can be initiated by tapping `OK` in the confirmation popup, or postponed by closing the popup with the `x` button.<br/>
    <img src=img/Creator_Knomi_Hi/en/hostname.jpg width="300"/>

### AP Interface

> <font size="2">If your device is connected to the Creator Knomi Hi AP hotspot to access the Web UI, any changes or shutdown of the Creator Knomi Hi AP settings will disconnect the device. To prevent this, it is recommended to connect your device to the same local network as Creator Knomi Hi before making changes.</font>

<img src=img/Creator_Knomi_Hi/en/ap.jpg width="300"/>

* ①	Access the `AP` interface.
* ②	Toggle the Creator Knomi Hi AP hotspot on or off.
When the AP hotspot is off, the device will no longer connect to Creator Knomi Hi’s hotspot for Web UI access. Before disabling it, ensure you record Creator Knomi Hi’s IP address on the current Wi-Fi network. Devices on the same Wi-Fi can still access the Web UI via this IP.
* ③	Modify the Creator Knomi Hi AP hotspot settings. The default configuration is:<br/>
  Wi-Fi Name:  `Creator_Knomi_Hi_xxxxxxxxxxxx`<br/>
  Wi-Fi Password: `987654321`<br/>
  IP Address:  `192.168.254.1`<br/>
  > <font size="2">Note: <br/>Changing only the name/password takes effect immediately.<br/>
  Changing the IP address requires a reboot.</font>

## Theme Settings & Sharing IMG Files

### Theme Settings <a id="theme-settings"></a>

<img src=img/Creator_Knomi_Hi/en/theme_1_2_3_4_5.jpg width="300"/>

    * c) H (Hue) ranges from 0° to 360°.
    * d) S (Saturation) ranges from 0% to 100%.
    * e) L (Lightness) ranges from 0% to 100%.
    * f) The hex RGB value — each value ranges from 0 to 255 (0x00 to 0xFF). You can directly modify this value to get your desired color. For example, the value #CCFF4D shown in the image means:
        * R (Red): 0xCC (204/255)
        * G (Green): 0xFF (255/255)
        * B (Blue): 0x4D (77/255)
    * g) The HSLA Values — Hue (H) ranges from 0–360°, Saturation (S) from 0–100%, and Lightness (L) from 0–100%. You can directly edit these values to achieve your desired color.
  For example, the value hsla(77, 100%, 65%) shown in the image means:
        * H (Hue): 77°
        * S (Saturation): 100%
        * L (Lightness): 65%
    * h) Tap to reset to the original GIF color.
    * i) Preview the color in the preview area.
* ④	View GIF Storage Usage：Due to Creator Knomi Hi’s hardware limitations, the total size of all GIFs cannot exceed 3MB (3072KB). If this limit is exceeded, the Web UI will block the update and display a pop-up reminder.
* ⑤	Set Each GIF Individually, including color and custom GIF images：<br/>
  Turn `Preview Mode` on/off to show/hide the `Preview` button. Tapping `Preview this GIF` enters preview mode, allowing you to view the custom GIF on the screen. To exit preview mode, turn off `Preview Mode` or navigate away from the `Theme` interface.<br/>
  Custom GIF Notes:<br/>
    * The screen resolution of the Creator Knomi Hi is `240 × 240 pixels` (width × height). GIFs larger than this will not display correctly. Only GIFs that are `240 × 240 pixels` or smaller are supported. If your GIF exceeds this size, we recommend resizing it using an online tool like [https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image/resize-gif](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image/resize-gif)
        * Click `Select images` or drag your GIF into the upload area.
        * Ensure `Maintain aspect ratio` is checked to prevent distortion.
        * Set the larger value—either `Width (px)` or `Height (px)`—to 240 or less. If both are equal, you can adjust either.
        * Click `Resize IMAGES`.
        * After processing, click `Download resized IMAGES` to save your optimized GIF.
    * Each individual GIF must be no larger than 1.5MB (1536KB). The total size of all GIFs must not exceed 3MB (3072KB).
    * When replacing a built-in GIF, the new GIF's size must not exceed the sum of the original GIF size and the remaining available space. You can check the available space in `④` and each GIF’s size in `⑤`.<br/>Example:<br/>&ensp;&nbsp;To replace `standby.gif` (242.21KB) with 1697.94KB of remaining space, the new GIF must be ≤ 1940.15KB(242.21KB + 1697.94KB).
