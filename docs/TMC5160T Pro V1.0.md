## **Interface Introduction**

### Installation and Interface

The Enable (EN) pin is highlighted in red in the diagram and located inside the marked white box on the driver:

## **Firmware Settings**

### Marlin

!!! note
    Marlin firmware version 2.0 or above is required for TMC5160's SPI mode.

Step 1: 

Open Configuration.h in your Marlin 2.0 firmware.

Find `#define MOTHERBOARD XXXXXX`

Check the `XXXXX` value. This is your board.

<img src=img/tmc5160t_pro/tmc5160t_pro_marlin1.png width="450"/>

Step 2: 

Go to the `Marlin/src/pins` directory. 

Open the `pins_xxxxxx.h` file that matches your board. (Remember, `xxxxxx` is your board model from Step 1). 

Find these lines:

```
X_CS_PIN
Y_CS_PIN
Z_CS_PIN
E0_CS_PIN
```

Change the pin numbers to the ones which you are using.

<img src=img/tmc5160t_pro/tmc5160t_pro_marlin2.png width="500"/>

Step 3: 

Stay in that same `pins_xxxxxx.h` file. (The one from Step 2).

Find these lines:

```
#define TMC_SW_MOSI XXX
#define TMC_SW_MISO XXX
#define TMC_SW_SCK XXX
```

Replace those `XXX` placeholders with the correct pin numbers for your setup.

<img src=img/tmc5160t_pro/tmc5160t_pro_marlin3.png width="500"/>

Step 4: 

Open the Configuration_adv.h file. Find the line #define TMC_USE_SW_SPI. 

Remove the // at the beginning of the line.

<img src=img/tmc5160t_pro/tmc5160t_pro_marlin4.png width="500"/>

Step 5: 

In `Configuration_adv.h`, find `#define X_CURRENT`, `#define X_MICROSTEPS`, 

`#define X_RSENSE` and modify the parameters (modifications are needed for all axes used), setting `RSENSE` for each axis to `0.075`.

<img src=img/tmc5160t_pro/tmc5160t_pro_marlin5.png width="500"/>

Step 6:

After completing step 5, open Configuration.h and locate `#define DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT` and modify the parameters to set microstepping, ensuring it corresponds with the microstepping from step 5.

For microstepping calculation, "80,80,400,96" represents 16 microsteps, and if changed to 32 microsteps it becomes "80*(32/16), 80*(32/16), 400*(32/16), 96*(32/16)".

### Klipper config example 

``` title="printer.cfg"
[tmc5160 stepper_x]
cs_pin: PD2
spi_software_sclk_pin: PC6
spi_software_mosi_pin: PC8
spi_software_miso_pin: PC7
run_current: 0.80
sense_resistor: 0.075

stealthchop_threshold: 0
diag1_pin: ^!PF3
driver_SGT: 0
```

## Change sensing resistor

!!! warning
    The TMC5160T Pro V1.0 uses a 0.075R current sensing resistor, which sets the maximum effective RMS current to 3.1A.

    <img src=img/tmc5160t_pro/tmc5160t_pro_marlin8.png width="450"/>

    If you require higher currents, it is possible to replace the current sensing resistor with a new one. Please note that you will need to source and solder it yourself.

    Ensure that the replacement resistor is no less than 0.066R due to the size constraints of the module.
    
    Replacing the resistor is not recommended, but if you decide to go ahead, you'll need to take responsibility for any damage that might happen during the swap.

    The location for the replacement resistor is indicated by the red box in the diagram below.

## **Cautions**

!!! warning "Cautions"
    Disconnect power before installing the driver to avoid damage.

    Ensure proper orientation during installation to prevent malfunction.

    Avoid hot-plugging the driver module to prevent damage.
