# Installation Guide

### Bambu Lab PX Series Hidden Wiring Installation

>(⚠️This method provides a fully hidden wiring solution. Since the process is more complex and involves some hands-on work, we recommend proceeding only if you feel confident with the steps.)

>**⚠️Please make sure the printer is powered off before beginning the following steps.**

* Step 1: Print the Control Board PCB Housing

<img src=img/panda_status/A1pcb.png width="600"/>

* Step 2: Install the control board into the printed housing. Snap the back cover securely into place, then attach the included double-sided tape to the back of the housing as shown.

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_8.jpg width="600"/>

* Step 3: Remove the rear panel of the printer. Attach the printed housing to the outer wall of the waste chute as shown, making sure the Type-C power port faces upward.

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_11.jpg width="600"/>

* Step 4: Raise the heated bed. Clean the mounting surface with an alcohol wipe followed by a dry cloth. 

<img src=img/panda_status/19.jpg width="600"/>

* Remove the protective film from the double-sided tape, then press the Panda Status firmly onto the front of the heated bed as shown. <br>
  Best results are achieved if left for 24 hours.

<img src=img/panda_status/25.jpg width="600"/>

* Step 5: Route the Status control cable through the indicated position to the underside of the heated bed. Connect it to the Status light bar and secure it with acetate tape as shown.

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_10.jpg width="600"/>

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_7.jpg width="600"/>

* Step 6: Bundle the Status control cable together with the heated bed wiring harness using the provided acetate tape. <br>Fix the bundled cables into the machine’s cable holder as shown. 

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_18.jpg width="600"/>

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_17.jpg width="600"/>

* Step 7: Plug the control cable into the control box.

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_2.jpg width="600"/>

* Step 8: Remove the screw shown to detach the printer’s drag chain cable cover.

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_1.jpg width="600"/>

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_3.jpg width="600"/>

* Step 9: Route the Type-C power cable into the printer as shown, then plug it into the control box. 

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_15.jpg width="600"/>

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_16.jpg width="600"/>

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_13.jpg width="600"/>

* Secure the cable with acetate tape along the routing path. 

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_5.jpg width="600"/>

* Pass the cable through the internal opening of the cable cover to the outside of the machine as shown, then reinstall the cover and fasten it back with the previously removed screw.

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_6.jpg width="600"/>

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_4.jpg width="600"/>

* Step 10: Replace the original plug with the included silicone plug for cable routing, as shown.

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_9.jpg width="600"/>

* Step 11: Route the cable out through the opening in the rear panel, then reinstall the panel.

<img src=img/panda_status/hide_12.jpg width="600"/>

### Notes

* The accessories include spare double-sided tape, which can be stacked to install the Panda Status in other positions.

  <img src=img/panda_status/26.jpg width="600"/>

#### Panda Status Installation Notes

Some users may notice small gaps or less-than-perfect adhesion during installation. This is normal and may happen for a few reasons:

1. **Universal design**: Panda Status is made to fit A, P, and X series printers, so it uses a more general size.

2. **Heatbed angle differences**: The vertical angle of the A1 heated bed is slightly different from that of the PX series. <br>
   And, on some PX printers, slight differences in the leveling knob positions under the heatbed can affect how well the Status light  bar fits.

<img src=img/panda_status/solve_1.png width="600"/>

<img src=img/panda_status/solve_2.png width="600"/>

3. The Status light bar has two contact surfaces as shown, and in practice, attaching only one side is usually enough to hold it firmly.

<img src=img/panda_status/solve_3.png width="600"/>

* Improving the Fit

  1. Apply double-sided tape only to the bottom side. (This provides sufficient strength but may leave a visible gap in front.)

<img src=img/panda_status/solve_4.png width="600"/>

<img src=img/panda_status/solve_5.png width="600"/>
    

  2. For improved appearance, use the spare double-sided tape included in the package (prepared specifically for this issue). Apply tape to both angled contact surfaces of the Status light bar before attaching it to the heated bed.

<img src=img/panda_status/solve_6.png width="600"/>

* Device Modes 

  * Mode 1: Music (Factory Default Mode)

    <img src=img/panda_status/en/rgb_music.jpg width="300"/>

    Brightness is set to 50% by default, adjustable from 0 to 100%.

    In this mode, RGB lights pulse rhythmically with the audio level, changing color from Blue → Green → Yellow → Orange → Red.
    Specific light effects:

    | -------- Low Audio -------- | ---- Medium Audio ---- | ---------High Audio -------- |
    | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |

    <img src=img/panda_status/music.gif width="600"/>

  * Mode 2: H2D Style

    <img src=img/panda_status/en/rgb_h2d.jpg width="300"/>

    Brightness is set to 50% by default, adjustable from 0 to 100%.

    In this mode, the RGB light will display various effects based on the printer's current status, as follows:

    Idle State: White breathing light (customizable color settings for this state: [How to set the color](#rgb_set_color))

    <img src=img/panda_status/printer_idle.gif width="600"/>

    Downloading Files: Yellow flow.

    <img src=img/panda_status/printer_loading.gif width="600"/>

    Pre-print Preparation: Yellow-orange flowing light.

    <img src=img/panda_status/printer_wave.gif width="600"/>

    Printing: White solid light that fills proportionally based on the printing percentage (customizable color settings for this state: [How to set the color](#rgb_set_color))

    <img src=img/panda_status/printer_printing.gif width="600"/>

    Print Completed: Green light stays on for 30 seconds before switching to the idle state light effect (default is white breathing light).

    <img src=img/panda_status/printer_complete.gif width="600"/>

    Print Paused: White breathing light.

    <img src=img/panda_status/printer_pause.gif width="600"/>

    Print Error: Red flashing light (customizable color settings for this state: [How to set the color](#rgb_set_color))

    <img src=img/panda_status/printer_error.gif width="600"/>


<a id="rgb_set_color"></a>

#### Customizing Light Color

* To set the color (using the idle state as an example):

  * In the control page, select the H2D mode. Under the "Color" option, you will see three boxes: Idle-white breathing light, Printing-white solid light that fills based on progress, and Error-red flashing light.

    <img src=img/panda_status/en/rgb_h2d.jpg width="300"/>

  * Select the idle state and click `Confirm` button.

    <img src=img/panda_status/en/rgb_h2d_idle.jpg width="300"/>

  * You will then be directed to the color selection page.

    <img src=img/panda_status/en/rgb_color_block.jpg width="300"/>

    * ① Factory default preset color.
    * ② Custom color

  * After selecting a color block, click `Confirm`.

    <img src=img/panda_status/en/rgb_set_block.jpg width="300"/>

  * The white idle light will change to the selected color, such as sky blue.

    <img src=img/panda_status/en/rgb_idle_ok.jpg width="300"/>

## Firmware History

### [V1.0.0](https://github.com/bigtreetech/Panda_Status/tree/master/Firmware/v1.0.0)

* First released factory firmware.

### [V1.0.1](https://github.com/bigtreetech/Panda_Status/tree/master/Firmware/v1.0.1)

* Change the access address of the AP web page from "192.168.4.1" in the factory firmware to "192.168.254.1" to avoid IP conflicts for users (users need to restore the factory Settings for this condition to take effect).

* Modify the firmware version from "V1.0.0" to "V1.0.1"

* After printing is completed, the green light remains on for 15 minutes and then changes to the idle mode light effect

* In non-MUSIC mode, if no print is made in the idle state for more than 120 minutes, it will automatically switch to standby mode and light up when the next print is initiated. When a user accesses or operates the Web UI or prints, the light bar is awakened (the light bar lights up).
