## **Replace the XY Timing Belt**

*  Step 1: Lower the Heated Bed, Then Power Off the Printer

    **Lower the heated bed**: Use the printer's control panel to lower the heated bed to its lowest position.

    **Turn off the printer**: Once the bed is fully lowered, power off the printer and disconnect it from the power supply for safety.

    Use the provided H1.5 hex key to unscrew the 4 screws securing the toolhead housings.

    Remove both the front and rear housings and set the screws and housings aside for reinstallation after the belt replacement.

*  Step 5: Take Out the Original Belt

    Use a hex key to unscrew the screws securing the timing belt.

    Use the provided pry tool or a slotted screwdriver to carefully pry out the fixing block.

    Use tweezers/pliers to gently grasp the fixing block and pull out the original belt.

    *Note: If the belt is still intact, hold it with your fingers and push it toward the fixing block to make it easier to pry off the fixing block.*

*  Step 6: Install the Panda Belt

    **Connect the new belt to the old one**: Take the Panda Belt, and thread both the new belt and the old belt’s fixing block through the heat shrink tubing. Then, heat the tubing to create a firm connection.

    **Replace the old belt with the new one**: Pull the other end of the old belt to guide the new belt through the path.

    **Secure the fixing block**: Use the provided glue to attach the fixing block to the other end of the new belt.

*  Step 7: Secure the Panda Belt

    Insert both ends of the new belt into the corresponding slots on both sides of the toolhead. Then reinstall the fixing screws.

    *Note*: Manually pull the belt tight to ensure there is no slack. After securing one end, pull the other end to ensure both sides are evenly tensioned. The belt should be taut, but not overly tight.

    *Tip*: Use the pry tool to ensure the fixing blocks are securely seated in the slots.
