## **Product Profile**

TMC2209 is an ultra-silent motor driver IC for two-phase stepper motors. Its continuous drive current is 2A and peak current is 2.8A. Compared with TMC2208, the driving current of this IC is not only improved by 0.6a-0.8a, but also this IC increases the function of locked-motor test.

The Flexible microPlyer interpolation unit can provide 256 microsteps. Stallguard4™locked-motor test can provide an abnormal signal when the motor rotates abnormally. CoolStep™ current dynamic control can save 75% energy. The sinusoidal control can be perfectly realized even in the system with limited pulse frequency. Since stealthChop2 ™ ultra-quiet technology is widely used in 3D printing, the design of these components is also compatible with existing 3D printer electronic devices, and it eliminates the expensive cost of redesigning.The module has a standard step/dir interface, it's easy to use.

## **Hardware Installation**

### **Microstep Setting**

<img src=img/TMC2209/TMC2209_Microstep.png width="600"/>


### **Standalone Mode V<sub>REF</sub> Setting:**

#### **Trinamic Driver Current Formula**  

$I_{RMS}=\frac{325mV}{R_{SENSE}+20mΩ}*\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}*\frac{V_{VREF}}{2.5V}$	

Our 2209 drivers utilise $110 mΩ _{RSENSE}$ resistors:
		
$I_{RMS}=\frac{325mV}{110mΩ+20mΩ}*\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}*\frac{V_{VREF}}{2.5V}$			
		
This simplifies to:

$I_{RMS}=\frac{V_{REF}}{\sqrt{2}}$

To Calculate Peak Current:

$I_{PEAK}=I_{RMS}*\sqrt{2}=V_{REF}$

!!! note 
    $V_{REF}$ range: 0.2V – 2.2V

    Factory default Vref(same as Peak Current): 1.2V +/- 0.1V

    Factory default RMS current: ~0.9A 

#### **Potentiometer regulation instructions**

1. Rotate the potentiometer clockwise to reduce the Vref voltage and the drive current can be reduced.

2. Rotate the potentiometer counterclockwise to increase the Vref voltage and the drive current can be increased.

### **Operating Mode**

#### **Pin setting of UART mode**

The factory has connected the UART Pin to the fourth Pin, namely the PDN_UART Pin shown on the left side of the figure below. If the fifthPin is used as the UART Pin, the resistance shall be removed and welded to the following two pads, as shown on the right side of the figure below. PDN is welded to select pins corresponding to UART mode；

#### **UART mode wiring diagram**

#### **Mute mode and anti-shake mode selection**

The default mode used by the factory is mute mode, as shown in the picture on the left of the following figure.If anti-shake mode is needed,remove the resistance and weld it to the following two pads, as shown in the picture on the right of the picture below.

## **Software Configuration**

### For Klipper Config UART

``` title="printer.cfg"
[tmc2209 stepper_x]
uart_pin: PC4
interpolate: false
run_current: 0.8
sense_resistor: 0.110
stealthchop_threshold: 0
```

### For marlin details, please follow docs

## **Precautions**

- Before installing the drive, make sure disconnect the power supply to prevent the drive from burning out.
- Before installing the drive, user must confirm the drive direction, to prevent back connection caused by the drive burning.

- Pay attention to the wiring sequence and I/O port when wiring. If the wrong line is connected, the driver will not work directly, please connect carefully as shown above.

- Do not plug and unplug the drive module when the device is working in order to avoid damage.

- When user install the heat sink, make sure the heat sink is not connected to the pin. We need prevent driving short circuit.

- The product is sensitive to static electricity, please handle it carefully. It is better that remove the package before using.

- Make sure to do heat dissipation treatment for the drive before using. (cooling pad, cooling fan)
