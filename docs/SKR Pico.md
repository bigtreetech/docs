​		(3) Please refer to BTT SKR Pico V1.0-PIN.pdf for Firmware DIY.

## **Precautions**

1. If you want to use a motor drive current of more than 0.8A, it is recommended to use a fan to actively cool the drive chip.
2. Do not remove the heat sink unless necessary. If it is to be removed, please ensure that the thermal conductive silicon film fits the bottom of the heat sink during installation, so as not to cause short circuit
3. The wiring must be performed when the power is off.Please make sure the wiring is correct before power on to avoid damage.
4. Please note that the jumper cap is correctly inserted.
