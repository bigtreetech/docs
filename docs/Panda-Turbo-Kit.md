### Functionality

**Manual Max Fan Speed Control**

Easily adjust the max fan speed with the top-mounted knob:

- Turn counterclockwise for quiet operation (~30% power, stock-like)
- Turn clockwise for maximum cooling (100% power)

No firmware tweaks needed - instant control at your fingertips.

### Internal and External Airflow Modes

The Panda Turbo Kit lets you switch between internal and external airflow and easily adjust the strength using the lever.

### Internal Circulation

Toggle the lever downward to draw internal air from the chamber — ideal for ABS, PETG, and high-temp materials. Minimize warping and enhance filtration efficiency with boosted airflow.
