## **Product Profile**

<p>TMC2130 is a high-performance two-phase stepper motor driver chip with a standard SPI interface and a simple step/dir interface. Very low noise, high load driver does not lose step.</p>

## **Features Highlights**

- Up to 256 subdivisions;

- Support SPI interface control;

- Do not lose step when driving under high load;

- Logic voltage: 3.3V/5V;

- Input voltage range: 12V/24V DC;

- Motor operating current 1.2a (peak 2A) can be adjusted;

- Spreadcycle ensures that the stepper motor has a smooth transition without dead zone current when passing zero.TMC2130 stepper motor driver chip has almost no jitter;

- StealthChop can drive the motor to work under extremely quiet sound, so it can be controlled the noise of the motor is below 10dB, which is much lower than that of the traditional current controllerType;

- SpreadCycle PWM chopped mode is automatically divided between slow and fast attenuators setting up a hysteresis attenuation function, the average current reflects the configured normal current in sine there will be no transition period at the zero crossing of the sine, which reduces the current and torque fluctuations that make the current waveform more similar to the sine wave. Compared with the traditional constant chopper mode of SpreadCycle PWM, the motor operates more smoothly and stably;

## **Specifications**

- **Highest Resolution** 256 microsteps per full step
- **Step/Dir Interface** with microstep interpolation

## **Hardware Configuration**

### **Working mode **

#### **STEP/DIR mode**

<img src=img/TMC2130/TMC2130_Step_mode.png width="600"/>

1.SPI position welding 0Ω resistor, making the driver work in STEP/DIR mode.

2.Working mode selection: SDI (CFG1), SCK (CFG2)

#### **SPI working mode wiring instructions**

Before wiring, it is necessary to select the hardware operation mode of the driver module:

<p>1.Solder CFG4 and CFG5 as shown in the purple area (CFG4 is connected to GND, CFG5 is connected to VCC); (Welding is correct to enable spreadcycle mode) </p>

<p>2.Remove the resistor at the SPI position to put the driver in SPI mode.</p>

**Wiring diagram is as follows:**

#### Potentiometer adjustment instructions

Rotate the potentiometer clockwise: reduce Vref to reduce the driver current;

Turn the potentiometer counterclockwise: Increase Vref to increase the driver current.

The exact voltage of Vref must be measured when the main board is supplied with 12V or 24V.

Range of Vref values: default: 1V (±0.2); MAX: 2.4V; MIN: 0V;

<p>Do not use too much force when rotating the potentiometer to prevent irreversible damage to the potentiometer; when it is rotated counterclockwise to the maximum value, it will become the minimum value if it continues to rotate; similarly, when it is rotated clockwise to the minimum value, If you continue to rotate, it will become the maximum value;</p>

## **Software Configuration**

## **Precautions**

- <p>When selecting SPI operation mode for hardware, please use soldering iron carefully to avoid burns. After processing, observe carefully whether there is residual tin residue in the module, and clean it up to prevent short-circuit and burning of the module;</p>

- <p>Please pay attention to the wire sequence and IO port when wiring. If the wrong wire is connected,the drive will not work. Connect them as shown above carefully .</p>

- <p>When the driver is inserted into the motherboard, please pay attention to see the direction of the drive, can not be inserted in reverse, to prevent the drive from burning;</p>

- <p>Be sure to do a good job before driving heat dissipation work (heat sink + fan), to prevent the drive is not working properly</p>
