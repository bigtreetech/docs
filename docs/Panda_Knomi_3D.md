## **Important Notice**:  

- **Printer Monitoring Only**: The Panda Knomi 3D is a monitoring-only device, meaning it reads the printer's status but does not control it. This key distinction ensures its core functionality remains unaffected by Bambu Lab firmware updates. For a detailed breakdown of which printer features are impacted by updates, please consult the [official Bambu Lab announcement](https://blog.bambulab.com/firmware-update-introducing-new-authorization-control-system-2/).

- **Firmware**: Ensure your device is running the latest [firmware version](https://github.com/bigtreetech/PandaKnomi3D/tree/master/Firmware).  

- **Wi-Fi Support**: The Panda Knomi 3D is compatible with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi networks only.  

- **Invalid IP Message**: If you see the message "Invalid IP, Adjusting" for an extended period, first check if you can control the printer normally using Bambu Handy or Bambu Studio. If the printer is unresponsive, the issue is likely your network environment and you should review your settings. If the printer operates correctly, please restart the Panda Knomi by turning it off and on. Should the problem continue after rebooting, contact customer support for further assistance at: `support01@bigtree-tech.com`

- **Web UI Access**: After connecting to the "Panda Knomi 3D AP" hotspot in your phone's settings, you will be automatically directed to its Web UI. Please note that due to system permissions on some mobile devices, you may be unable to upload GIFs, IMG files, or firmware updates from this screen. To perform these actions reliably, please open the Web UI address directly in a mobile browser.

- **GitHub Feedback**: We value your feedback. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving future hardware or firmware versions, please feel free to [submit](https://github.com/bigtreetech/PandaKnomi3D/issues) them on GitHub.

### Wi-Fi & IP Interface

> The first screen displayed in the Panda Knomi 3D Web UI is the **Wi-Fi & IP** settings page.

<img src=img/PandaKnomi3D/en/wifi_ip.jpg width="300"/>

* ① Enter the **Wi-Fi & IP** interface

* ② To reconfigure the Wi-Fi connection for Panda Knomi 3D, click the **Wi-Fi Network Configuration** button to return to the Wi-Fi configuration screen.

    > <font size="2">Tip: When Panda Knomi 3D switches to a different Wi-Fi network, its local network and IP address may change. If you change this setting on a device within the same network, communication with Panda Knomi 3D will be lost. The device will need to reconnect to the newly configured Wi-Fi. To avoid this, we recommend connecting your device to Panda Knomi 3D’s AP hotspot first, then changing the configuration.</font>

* ③ Once the network configuration is complete, we recommend connecting your phone, computer, or other devices to the same Wi-Fi network as Panda Knomi 3D. Access the Web UI via the IP address in your browser’s address bar. You can also save the IP address as a bookmark on your home screen for easy access.

* ④ If your device is on the same network as Panda Knomi 3D, you can access the Web UI using the hostname. The default hostname is **PandaKnomi3D**, accessible at [http://pandaknomi3d.local](http://pandaknomi3d.local) (case-insensitive). If your device is using a VPN, this method may not work, and you should use the IP address instead.

    Users can customize the hostname by following these rules:

    * It must consist of letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), and hyphens (-), with the first character being a letter.

    * It must be between 8 and 32 characters long.

    After changing, click **Set Hostname** to apply the new hostname to Panda Knomi 3D. If a pop-up window appears, the hostname has been successfully updated. The new hostname will take effect after a reboot. Click **OK** to reboot Panda Knomi 3D immediately, or click the **x** button to close the window without rebooting.

    <img src=img/PandaKnomi3D/en/hostname.jpg width="300"/>

### AP Interface

> The next screen in the Panda Knomi 3D Web UI is the **AP interface**. The Panda Knomi 3D AP is the Wi-Fi hotspot broadcast by the device, allowing a phone or computer to connect directly.
> You can disable the hotspot broadcast if you wish. However, please note that the Panda Knomi 3D is designed to automatically re-enable its hotspot if it loses the connection to your configured Wi-Fi network. This provides a fail-safe method to regain access and reconfigure the device should your network become unavailable.
>
> <font size="2">**Tip:** If you are currently connected to the Web UI via the "Panda Knomi 3D AP" hotspot, you will be disconnected immediately if you disable or change the AP settings. To maintain a stable connection while adjusting these settings, please ensure your device is connected to the same local Wi-Fi network as the Panda Knomi 3D beforehand.

</font>

<img src=img/PandaKnomi3D/en/ap.jpg width="300"/>

* ① Enter the **AP** interface.

* ② Enable/disable the Panda Knomi 3D AP hotspot.

    * Once disabled, you will no longer be able to connect to Panda Knomi 3D through its hotspot.

    * Before disabling, make sure to note the Panda Knomi 3D IP address on the current Wi-Fi so you can still access the Web UI via IP.

* ③ Edit the Panda Knomi 3D AP hotspot settings. The default configuration is:

    Wi-Fi Name: `Panda_Knomi_3D_xxxxxxxxxxxx`
    Wi-Fi Password: `987654321`

  No reboot is necessary after applying these changes. The device will automatically recreate the AP hotspot in the background.

* ④ Change the AP hotspot IP address. If the IP range conflicts with your router (for example, if both use `192.168.254.1`), Panda Knomi 3D will be unable to bind to the printer. To resolve this, change the **Hotspot IP** to a different range, such as `192.168.253.1`.

    After modifying the **Hotspot IP**, you must reboot the device for the new settings to take effect. If the following pop-up appears, the **Hotspot IP** has been successfully updated. Click **OK** to reboot Panda Knomi 3D immediately, or click the **x** in the upper-right corner to close the pop-up without rebooting.

### GIF Status Explanation

* Due to hardware limitations, Panda Knomi 3D requires that the size of a single GIF not exceed 1.5MB (1536KB, 1MB = 1024KB), and the total size of all GIFs must not exceed 3MB (3072KB, 1MB = 1024KB).

* In its factory state, the total space occupied by all pre-loaded GIFs is 2903.28 KB. This leaves 168.72 KB of available space for your custom images.
Please note that the total size may differ slightly from the sum of individual GIFs listed in the table due to file system overhead and rounding of individual file sizes.

### Screen Saver

> To prevent screen burn-in from long exposure to static images, Panda Knomi includes a built-in screen saver. Every 15 seconds, a screen saver GIF (non-customizable) will appear for 7.5 seconds. 

* The screen saver GIF is as follows:

    <img src=img/PandaKnomi3D/gif/screen_saver.gif />

* The screen saver is active on the following interfaces: 

    * Invalid IMG interface

    * 'Hello' screen at factory settings

    * Wi-Fi scan completion

    * Wi-Fi connection failure

    * Wi-Fi password error

    * Binding printer interface

    * Printer scan completion

    * Printer SN error

    * Printer Access Code error

### Theme Settings

<img src=img/PandaKnomi3D/en/theme_1_2_3_4_5.jpg width="300"/>

<img src=img/PandaKnomi3D/en/theme_6.jpg width="300"/>

<img src=img/PandaKnomi3D/en/settings_7_8.jpg width="300"/>

* ① Enter the **Theme** interface.  

* ② Choose the print progress display option, with the following 4 choices:  

    * **Overlay Percentage on GIF**: While printing, the screen shows a custom GIF (factory GIF), with the real-time print progress overlaid.  

    * **Show Percentage Only**: While printing, the screen shows only the real-time print progress.

    * **Show GIF Only**: While printing, the screen displays a GIF representing the printing process.

    * **Alternate Between Percentage and GIF**: While printing, the screen alternates between real-time print progress and the GIF, switching every 10 seconds.

* ③ Set the GIF color.

    <img src=img/PandaKnomi3D/en/picker.jpg width="300"/>

    * a) Click this button to open the GIF color settings interface.

    * b) HSL Color Picker ([What is HSL?](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL%E5%92%8CHSV%E8%89%B2%E5%BD%A9%E7%A9%BA%E9%97%B4))

    * c) HSL **Hue** parameter ranges from: 0 ~ 360°

    * d) HSL **Saturation** parameter ranges from: 0 ~ 100%

    * e) HSL **Lightness** parameter ranges from: 0 ~ 100%

    * f) The corresponding RGB hexadecimal value of the color, where each value ranges from 0 ~ 255 (0x00 ~ 0xFF). You can modify these values to get the desired color. For example, #FF5703 means:

        * R (Red): 0xFF (255/255)

        * G (Green): 0x57 (87/255)

        * B (Blue): 0x03 (3/255)

    * g) The corresponding HSL value of the color, where H (Hue) ranges from 0 ~ 360°, S (Saturation) from 0 ~ 100%, and L (Lightness) from 0 ~ 100%. You can modify these values to get the desired color. For example, **hsl(20, 100%, 51%)** means:

        * H (Hue): 20°

        * S (Saturation): 100%

        * L (Lightness): 51%

    * h) Click to clear the selected color, and the GIF will return to its original color.

    * i) Preview area for the set color.

* ④ Check the GIF storage usage. Due to hardware limitations, the total size of all GIFs cannot exceed 3MB (3072KB). If the total size exceeds this, the Web UI will block the update and display a pop-up reminder.

* ⑤ Each GIF can be set individually, including color and custom GIFs.

    You can turn on/off the **Preview GIF** switch to show/hide the **Preview** button. Click **Preview GIF** to enter preview mode, where the screen will display "Preview GIF" and you can view the effect of the custom GIF. To exit preview mode, turn off the **Preview GIF** switch or switch to a different interface.

    **Note for Custom GIFs**

    * For optimal display, use GIFs that match the Panda Knomi 3D's screen resolution of **240 x 240** pixels. Any GIFs larger than the given resolution will not be fully displayed.  We recommend using a tool like ILoveIMG's Resize GIF to adjust your files. [Resize GIF](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image/resize-gif).

        * Click **Select images** to choose a GIF, or drag and drop the GIF into the interface.

        * Check the **Maintain aspect ratio** box to avoid distortion.

        * Adjust the larger parameter in **Width (px)** or **Height (px)** to not exceed 240px. If both parameters are the same, you can adjust either one.

        * Click **Resize IMAGES**.

        * Once the resizing is complete, click the **Download resized IMAGES** button to save your new GIF.

    * The size of each individual GIF cannot exceed 1.5MB (1536KB), and the total size of all GIFs cannot exceed 3MB (3072KB).

    * A new GIF cannot be larger than the available space. The maximum size allowed is the combined total of the GIF you are replacing and the remaining free space.  If a file exceeds this limit, the Web UI will reject it and display a warning pop-up. Check the remaining space in **④** and the size of each GIF in **⑤**.

        Example:

        &ensp;&nbsp;To replace **Standby.gif** with a new GIF, the factory GIF size is 63.61KB, and the remaining space is 407.75KB, so the new GIF size must not exceed 63.61KB + 407.75KB = 471.36KB.

* ⑥ Export the custom GIF as an **IMG** file for backup or sharing your custom GIF design.

* ⑦ ⑧ Upload and update shared **IMG** files from others to Panda Knomi 3D.

### How to Update Firmware

#### OTA

* Open the Web UI configuration page.

  > <font size="2">If Panda Knomi 3D is already connected to Wi-Fi, you can access the Web UI from any device connected to the same local network (via Wi-Fi or Ethernet).
  > Alternatively, connect directly to the Panda Knomi 3D AP hotspot. Both methods work.</font>

    * **Option 1: Local Network Access**

        * Connect your device to the same local network as Panda Knomi 3D.

        * In your browser, enter the device’s IP address or hostname. The default hostname is: `http://pandaknomi3d.local`.

        * If a VPN is enabled, hostname resolution may fail. In that case, use the IP address directly.

    * **Option 2: Connect via AP Hotspot**

        * Connect your device to the Panda Knomi 3D AP hotspot. Example (iPhone):

            * Go to **Settings** → **Wi-Fi**.

            * Enable Wi-Fi. Your device will scan for networks.

                <img src=img/PandaKnomi3D/en/wlan.jpg width="300"/>

            * Select the network starting with **Panda\_Knomi\_3D\_**, and enter the default password: `987654321`.

            * Once connected, a blue checkmark will appear next to the network name, and the Wi-Fi icon will be displayed in the status bar.

        * After connecting, you should see a **“Connected (Login/Authentication Required)”** prompt that redirects to the Web UI.

        * If not, wait 10–20 seconds. If it still fails, manually open [192.168.254.1](http://192.168.254.1) in your browser.

* In the Web UI, go to ① **Settings**, click ② **Select .bin File**, choose the firmware file, and update. The device will reboot automatically after the update.
